<h3>Biografia:</h3></center>
<P lang="en" align="justify">
Julius Caesar was born in Rome on July 12 or 13, in the year 100 B.C.. 
Caesar's family was part of Rome's original aristocracy, called patricians, 
although they were not rich or particularly influential. To obtain distinction 
for himself and his family, a Roman nobleman sought election to public office. 
The position was one of an archaic priesthood and held no power. Nevertheless, 
it identified Caesar with extremist politics. Ceasar committed himself further 
to the radical side when he married Cornelia, daughter of Lucius Cornelius Cinna 
in 84 B.C.. In 82 B.C., Caesar was ordered to divorce his wife by Lucius Cornelius 
Sulla, an enemy of the radicals. Caesar refused and prudently left Rome for military
 service in Asia and Cilicia. He returned in 78 B.C. when Sulla died and began his 
 political career as a prosecuting advocate. Caesar then traveled to Rhodes to study
  rhetoric and did not return to Rome until 73 B.C. During his journey to Rhodes, 
  Caesar was captured by pirates. While in captivity, Caesar convinced his captors 
  to raise his ransom, which increased his prestige. He then raised a naval force, 
  overcame his captors, and had them crucified. In 69 or 68 B.C., Caesar was elected 
  quaestor. His wife died shortly thereafter. In a purely political maneuver, Caesar 
  seized the opportunity to praise his uncle, Cinna and father-in-law, Marius during 
  the funeral orations for his deceased wife. He then married Pompeia, a relative of 
  Pompey. Caesar was elected curule aedile in 65 B.C., pontifex maximus in 63 B.C., 
  and a praetor in 62 B.C. By this time, Caesar was making a name for himself as a 
  political figure. He divorced Pompeia after a scandal. Caesar was made governor of 
  Farther Spain in 61 B.C. When he returned to Rome the next year, he joined forces 
  with Crassus and Pompey and formed the first triumvirate. The alliance between Pompey 
  and Ceasar was solidified further when Pompey married Julia, Caesar's only child. 
  Caesar's next step up the political ladder was to be elected consul in 59 B.C. 
  During that year he also married Calpurnia. The following year, Caesar was appointed
   governor of Roman Gaul. During the next 8 years, Caesar successfully conquered 
   Gallic Gaul to the north. In 49 B.C., Caesar was instructed by the Senate to lay 
   down his command. Roman politics had changed following the death of Crassus in 53 
   B.C., and Pompey was appointed sole consul in 52 B.C.. In addition, Pompey's wife 
   Julia died in 54 B.C., breaking the family ties between Pompey and Caesar. On 
   January 10-11, 49 B.C., Caesar crossed the Rubicon, a small river separating 
   Gaul from Italy, signifying the start of the Roman Civil War. Pompey fled and 
   within three months, Caesar ruled of all Italy. He then took Spain and continued
    to pursue Pompey all the way to Egypt. In 48 B.C., Pompey was murdered by an 
    officer of King Ptolemy. Caesar remained in Egypt throughout the winter and 
    dallied with Queen Cleopatra. In 48 B.C., Caesar assumed the title of dictator. 
    He returned to Rome for a short time in 47 B.C. but then left for Africa to crush 
    his opponents. Caesar departed for Farther Spain in 46 B.C. to put down resistance 
    there. In 45 B.C., Caesar returned to Rome to put his empire in order. On March 15, 
    44 B.C., a day known as the Ides of March, Caesar entered the Senate House. An 
    assassination plot had been hatched by a group of 60 senators, including Gaius
     Cassius and Marcus Junius Brutus. As Caesar entered the Senate, he was stabbed 
     23 times. After Ceasar was assassinated, Rome experienced another 13 years of civil war.
