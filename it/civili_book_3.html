<p align="justify"> 49-48 B.C.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.1": [3.1] Julius Caesar, holding the election
as dictator, was himself appointed consul with Publius Servilius; for this
was the year in which it
was permitted by the laws that he should be chosen consul. This business
being ended, as credit was beginning to fail in Italy, and the debts could
not be
paid, he determined that arbitrators should be appointed: and that
they should make an estimate of the possessions and properties [of the
debtors], how
much they were worth before the war, and that they should be handed
over in payment to the creditors. This he thought the most likely method
to remove
and abate the apprehension of an abolition of debt, the usual consequence
of civil wars and dissensions, and to support the credit of the debtors.
He
likewise restored to their former condition (the praetors and tribunes,
first submitting the question to the people) some persons condemned for
bribery at
the elections, by virtue of Pompey's law, at the time when Pompey kept
his legions quartered in the city (these trials were finished in a single
day, one
judge hearing the merits, and another pronouncing the sentences), because
they had offered their service to him in the beginning of the civil war,
if he chose
to accept them; setting the same value on them as if he had accepted
them, because they had put themselves in his power. For he had determined
that they
ought to be restored rather by the judgment of the people than appear
admitted to it by his bounty: that he might neither appear ungrateful in
repaying an
obligation, nor arrogant in depriving the people of their prerogative
of exercising this bounty.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.2": [3.2] In accomplishing these things,
and celebrating the Latin festival, and holding all the elections, he spent
eleven days; and having
resigned the dictatorship, set out from the city, and went to Brundusium,
where he had ordered twelve legions and all his cavalry to meet him. But
he
scarcely found as many ships as would be sufficient to transport fifteen
thousand legionary soldiers and five hundred horse. This [the scarcity
of shipping]
was the only thing that prevented Caesar from putting a speedy conclusion
to the war. And even these troops embarked very short of their number,
because several had fallen in so many wars in Gaul, and the long march
from Spain had lessened their number very much, and a severe autumn in
Apulia
and the district about Brundusium, after the very wholesome countries
of Spain and Gaul, had impaired the health of the whole army.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.3": [3.3] Pompey having got a year's respite
to provide forces, during which he was not engaged in war, nor employed
by an enemy, had
collected a numerous fleet from Asia, and the Cyclades, from Corcyra,
Athens, Pontus, Bithynia, Syria, Cilicia, Phoenicia, and Egypt, and had
given
directions that a great number should be built in every other place.
He had exacted a large sum of money from Asia, Syria, and all the kings,
dynasts,
tetrarchs, and free states of Achaia; and had obliged the corporations
of those provinces, of which he himself had the government, to count down
to him a
large sum.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.4": [3.4] He had made up nine legions
of Roman citizens; five from Italy, which he had brought with him; one
veteran legion from Sicily,
which being composed of two he called the Gemella; one from Crete and
Macedonia, of veterans who had been discharged by their former generals
and
had settled in those provinces; two from Asia, which had been levied
by the activity of Lentulus. Besides, he had distributed among his legions
a
considerable number, by way of recruits, from Thessaly, Boeotia, Achaia,
and Epirus: with his legions he also intermixed the soldiers taken from
Caius
Antonius. Besides these, he expected two legions from Syria, with Scipio;
from Crete, Lacedaemon, Pontus, Syria, and other states, he got about three
thousand archers, six cohorts of slingers, two thousand mercenary soldiers,
and seven thousand horse; six hundred of which, Deiotarus had brought from
Gaul; Ariobarzanes, five hundred from Cappadocia. Cotus had given him
about the same number from Thrace, and had sent his son Sadalis with them.
From Macedonia there were two hundred, of extraordinary valor, commanded
by Rascipolis; five hundred Gauls and Germans; Gabinius's troops from
Alexandria, whom Aulus Gabinius had left with king Ptolemy, to guard
his person. Pompey, the son, had brought in his fleet eight hundred, whom
he had
raised among his own and his shepherds' slaves. Tarcundarius, Castor
and Donilaus, had given three hundred from Gallograecia: one of these came
himself, the other sent his son. Two hundred were sent from Syria by
Comagenus Antiochus, whom Pompey rewarded amply. The most of them were
archers. To these were added Dardanians and Bessians, some of them
mercenaries; others procured by power and influence: also, Macedonians,
Thessalians, and troops from other nations and states, which completed
the number which we mentioned before.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.5": [3.5] He had laid in vast quantities
of corn from Thessaly, Asia, Egypt, Crete, Cyrene, and other countries.
He had resolved to fix his
winter quarters at Dyrrachium, Apollonia, and the other seaports, to
hinder Caesar from passing the sea: and for this purpose had stationed
his fleet along
the sea-coast. The Egyptian fleet was commanded by Pompey, the son:
the Asiatic, by Decimus Laelius, and Caius Triarius: the Syrian, by Caius
Cassius:
the Rhodian, by Caius Marcellus, in conjunction with Caius Coponius:
and the Liburnian and Achaian, by Scribonius Libo, and Marcus Octavius.
But
Marcus Bibulus was appointed commander-in-chief of the whole maritime
department, and regulated every matter. The chief direction rested upon
him.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.6": [3.6] When Caesar came to Brundusium,
he made a speech to the soldiers: "That since they were now almost arrived
at the termination
of their toils and dangers, they should patiently submit to leave their
slaves and baggage in Italy, and to embark without luggage, that a greater
number of
men might be put on board: that they might expect every thing from
victory and his liberality." They cried out with one voice, "he might give
what orders he
pleased, that they would cheerfully fulfill them." He accordingly set
sail the fourth day of January, with seven legions on board, as already
remarked. The
next day he reached land, between the Ceraunian rocks and other dangerous
places; meeting with a safe road for his shipping to ride in, and dreading
all
other ports which he imagined were in possession of the enemy, he landed
his men at a place called Pharsalus, without the loss of a single vessel.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.7": [3.7] Lucretius Vespillo and Minutius
Rufus were at Oricum, with eighteen Asiatic ships, which were given into
their charge by the
orders of Decimus Laelius: Marcus Bibulus at Corcyra, with a hundred
and ten ships. But they had not the confidence to dare to move out of the
harbor;
though Caesar had brought only twelve ships as a convoy, only four
of which had decks; nor did Bibulus, his fleet being disordered and his
seamen
dispersed, come up in time: for Caesar was seen at the continent, before
any account whatsoever of his approach had reached those regions.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.8": [3.8] Caesar, having landed his soldiers,
sent back his ships the same night to Brundusium, to transport the rest
of his legions and
cavalry. The charge of this business was committed to lieutenant Fufius
Kalenus, with orders to be expeditious in transporting the legions. But
the ships
having put to sea too late, and not having taken advantage of the night
breeze, fell a sacrifice on their return. For Bibulus at Corcyra, being
informed of
Caesar's approach, hoped to fall in with some part of our ships, with
their cargoes, but found them empty; and having taken about thirty, vented
on them
his rage at his own remissness, and set them all on fire: and, with
the same flames, he destroyed the mariners and masters of the vessels,
hoping by the
severity of the punishment to deter the rest. Having accomplished this
affair, he filled all the harbors and shores from Salona to Oricum with
his fleets.
Having disposed his guard with great care, he lay on board himself
in the depth of winter, declining no fatigue or duty, and not waiting for
reinforcements,
in hopes that he might come within Caesar's reach.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.9": [3.9] But after the departure Of the
Liburnian fleet, Marcus Octavius sailed from Illyricum with what ships
he had to Salona, and having
spirited up the Dalmatians, and other barbarous nations, he drew Issa
off from its connection with Caesar; but not being able to prevail with
the council of
Salona, either by promises or menaces, he resolved to storm the town.
But it was well fortified by its natural situation and a hill. The Roman
citizens built
wooden towers, the better to secure it; but when they were unable to
resist, on account of the smallness of their numbers, being weakened by
several
wounds, they stooped to the last resource, and set at liberty all the
slaves old enough to bear arms; and cutting the hair off the women's heads,
made
ropes for their engines. Octavius, being informed of their determination,
surrounded the town with five encampments, and began to press them at once
with a siege and storm. They were determined to endure every hardship,
and their greatest distress was the want of corn. They, therefore, sent
deputies to
Caesar, and begged a supply from him; all other inconveniences they
bore by their own resources, as well as they could: and after a long interval,
when
the length of the siege had made Octavius's troops more remiss than
usual, having got an opportunity at noon, when the enemy were dispersed,
they
disposed their wives and children on the walls, to keep up the appearance
of their usual attention; and forming themselves into one body, with the
slaves
whom they had lately enfranchised, they made an attack on Octavius's
nearest camp, and having forced that, attacked the second with the same
fury; and
then the third and the fourth, and then the other, and beat them from
them all: and having killed a great number, obliged the rest and Octavius
himself to fly
for refuge to their ships. This put an end to the blockade. Winter
was now approaching, and Octavius, despairing of capturing the town, after
sustaining
such considerable losses, withdrew to Pompey, to Dyrrachium.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.10": [3.10] We have mentioned, that Vibullius
Rufus, an officer of Pompey's had fallen twice into Caesar's power; first
at Corfinium, and
afterward in Spain. Caesar thought him a proper person, on account
of his favors conferred on him, to send with proposals to Pompey: and he
knew that
he had an influence over Pompey. This was the substance of his proposals:
"That it was the duty of both, to put an end to their obstinacy, and forbear
hostilities, and not tempt fortune any further; that sufficient loss
had been suffered on both sides, to serve as a lesson and instruction to
them, to render
them apprehensive of future calamities, by Pompey, in having been driven
out of Italy, and having lost Sicily, Cardinia, and the two Spains, and
one
hundred and thirty cohorts of Roman citizens, in Italy and Spain: by
himself, in the death of Curio, and the loss of so great an army in Africa,
and the
surrender of his soldiers in Corcyra. Wherefore, they should have pity
on themselves, and the republic: for, from their own misfortunes, they
had sufficient
experience of what fortune can effect in war. That this was the only
time to treat for peace; when each had confidence in his own strength,
and both
seemed on an equal footing. Since, if fortune showed ever so little
favor to either, he who thought himself superior, would not submit to terms
of
accommodation; nor would be content with an equal division, when he
might expect to obtain the whole. That as they could not agree before,
the terms of
peace ought to be submitted to the senate and people in Rome. That
in the mean time, it ought to content the republic and themselves, if they
both
immediately took oath in a public assembly that they would disband
their forces within the three following days. That having divested themselves
of the
arms and auxiliaries, on which they placed their present confidence,
they must both of necessity acquiesce in the decision of the people and
senate. To
give Pompey the fuller assurance of his intentions, he would dismiss
all his forces on the land, even his garrisons.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.11": [3.11] Vibullius, having received
this commission from Caesar, thought it no less necessary to give Pompey
notice of Caesar's sudden
approach, that he might adopt such plans as the circumstance required,
than to inform him of Caesar's message; and therefore continuing his journey
by
night as well as by day, and taking fresh horses for dispatch, he posted
away to Pompey, to inform him that Caesar was marching toward him with
all his
forces. Pompey was at this time in Candavia, and was on his march from
Macedonia to his winter quarters in Apollonia and Dyrrachium; but surprised
at
the unexpected news, he determined to go to Apollonia by speedy marches,
to prevent Caesar from becoming master of all the maritime states. But
as
soon as Caesar had landed his troops, he set off the same day for Oricum:
when he arrived there, Lucius Torquatus, who was governor of the town by
Pompey's appointment, and had a garrison of Parthinians in it, endeavored
to shut the gates and defend the town, and ordered the Greeks to man the
walls, and to take arms. But as they refused to fight against the power
of the Roman people, and as the citizens made a spontaneous attempt to
admit
Caesar, despairing of any assistance, he threw open the gates, and
surrendered himself and the town to Caesar, and was preserved safe from
injury by
him.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.12": [3.12] Having taken Oricum, Caesar
marched without making any delay to Apollonia. Staberius the governor,
hearing of his
approach, began to bring water into the citadel, and to fortify it,
and to demand hostages of the town's people. But they refuse to give any,
or to shut their
gates against the consul, or to take upon them to judge contrary to
what all Italy and the Roman people had judged. As soon as he knew their
inclinations,
he made his escape privately. The inhabitants of Apollonia sent embassadors
to Caesar, and gave him admission into their town. Their example was
followed by the inhabitants of Bullis, Amantia, and the other neighboring
states, and all Epirus: and they sent embassadors to Caesar, and promised
to
obey his commands.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.13": [3.13] But Pompey having received
information of the transactions at Oricum and Apollonia, began to be alarmed
for Dyrrachium, and
endeavored to reach it, marching day and night. As soon as it was said
that Caesar was approaching, such a panic fell upon Pompey's army, because
in
his haste he had made no distinction between night and day, and had
marched without intermission, that they almost every man deserted their
colors in
Epirus and the neighboring countries; several threw down their arms,
and their march had the appearance of a flight. But when Pompey had halted
near
Dyrrachium, and had given orders for measuring out the ground for his
camp, his army even yet continuing in their fright, Labienus first stepped
forward
and swore that he would never desert him, and would share whatever
fate fortune should assign to him. The other lieutenants took the same
oath, and the
tribunes and centurions followed their example: and the whole army
swore in like manner. Caesar, finding the road to Dyrrachium already in
the
possession of Pompey, was in no great haste, but encamped by the river
Apsus, in the territory of Apollonia, that the states which had deserved
his
support might be certain of protection from his out-guards and forts;
and there he resolved to wait the arrival of his other legions from Italy,
and to winter
in tents. Pompey did the same; and pitching his camp on the other side
of the river Apsus, collected there all his troops and auxiliaries.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.14": [3.14] Kalenus, having put the legions
and cavalry on board at Brundusium, as Caesar had directed him, as far
as the number of his
ships allowed, weighed anchor: and having sailed a little distance
from port, received a letter from Caesar, in which he was informed, that
all the ports and
the whole shore was occupied by the enemy's fleet: on receiving this
information he returned into the harbor, and recalled all the vessels.
One of them,
which continued the voyage and did not obey Kalenus's command, because
it carried no troops, but was private property, bore away for Oricum, and
was taken by Bibulus, who spared neither slaves nor free men, nor even
children; but put all to the sword. Thus the safety of the whole army depended
on
a very short space of time and a great casualty.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.15": [3.15] Bibulus, as has been observed
before, lay with his fleet near Oricum, and as he debarred Caesar of the
liberty of the sea and
harbors, so he was deprived of all intercourse with the country by
land; for the whole shore was occupied by parties disposed in different
places by
Caesar. And he was not allowed to get either wood or water, or even
anchor near the land. He was reduced to great difficulties, and distressed
with
extreme scarcity of every necessary; insomuch that he was obliged to
bring, in transports from Corcyra, not only provisions, but even wood and
water;
and it once happened that, meeting with violent storms, they were forced
to catch the dew by night which fell on the hides that covered their decks;
yet all
these difficulties they bore patiently and without repining, and thought
they ought not to leave the shores and harbors free from blockade. But
when they
were suffering under the distress which I have mentioned, and Libo
had joined Bibulus, they both called from on ship-board, to Marcus Acilius
and Statius
Marcus, the lieutenants, one of whom commanded the town, the other
the guards on the coast, that they wished to speak to Caesar on affairs
of
importance, if permission should be granted them. They add something
further to strengthen the impression that they intended to treat about
an
accommodation. In the mean time they requested a truce, and obtained
it from them; for what they proposed seemed to be of importance, and it
was well
known that Caesar desired it above all things, and it was imagined
that some advantage would be derived from Bibulus's proposals.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.16": [3.16] Caesar having set out with
one legion to gain possession of the more remote states, and to provide
corn, of which he had but a
small quantity, was at this time at Buthrotum, opposite to Corcyra.
There receiving Acilius and Marcus's letters, informing him of Libo's and
Bibulus's
demands, he left his legion behind him, and returned himself to Oricum.
When he arrived, they were invited to a conference. Libo came and made
an
apology for Bibulus, "that he was a man of strong passion, and had
a private quarrel against Caesar, contracted when he was aedile and praetor;
that for
this reason he had avoided the conference, lest affairs of the utmost
importance and advantage might be impeded by the warmth of his temper.
That it now
was and ever had been Pompey's most earnest wish, that they should
be reconciled and lay down their arms, but they were not authorized to
treat on that
subject, because they resigned the whole management of the war, and
all other matters to Pompey, by order of the council. But when they were
acquainted with Caesar's demands, they would transmit them to Pompey,
who would conclude all of himself by their persuasions. In the mean time,
let the
truce be continued till the messengers could return from him; and let
no injury be done on either side." To this he added a few words of the
cause for
which they fought, and of his own forces and resources.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.17": [3.17] To this, Caesar did not then
think proper to make any reply, nor do we now think it worth recording.
But Caesar required "that
he should be allowed to send commissioners to Pompey, who should suffer
no personal injury; and that either they should grant it, or should take
his
commissioners in charge, and convey them to Pompey. That as to the
truce, the war in its present state was so divided, that they by their
fleet deprived
him of his shipping and auxiliaries; while he prevented them from the
use of the land and fresh water; and if they wished that this restraint
should be
removed from them, they should relinquish their blockade of the seas,
but if they retained the one, he in like manner would retain the other;
that
nevertheless, the treaty of accommodation might still be carried on,
though these points were not conceded, and that they need not be an impediment
to
it." They would neither receive Caesar's commissioners, nor guarantee
their safety, but referred the whole to Pompey. They urged and struggled
eagerly to
gain the one point respecting a truce. But when Caesar perceived that
they had proposed the conference merely to avoid present danger and distress,
but
that they offered no hopes or terms of peace, he applied his thoughts
to the prosecution of the war.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.18": [3.18] Bibulus, being prevented from
landing for several days, and being seized with a violent distemper from
the cold and fatigue, as
he could neither be cured on board, nor was willing to desert the charge
which he had taken upon him, was unable to bear up against the violence
of the
disease. On his death, the sole command devolved on no single individual,
but each admiral managed his own division separately, and at his own
discretion. Vibullius, as soon as the alarm, which Caesar's unexpected
arrival had raised, was over, began again to deliver Caesar's message in
the
presence of Libo, Lucius Lucceius, and Theophanes, to whom Pompey used
to communicate his most confidential secrets. He had scarcely entered on
the subject when Pompey interrupted him, and forbade him to proceed.
"What need," says he, "have I of life or Rome, if the world shall think
I enjoy them
by the bounty of Caesar: an opinion which can never be removed while
it shall be thought that I have been brought back by him to Italy, from
which I set
out." After the conclusion of the war, Caesar was informed of these
expressions by some persons who were present at the conversation. He attempted,
however, by other means to bring about a negotiation of peace.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.19": [3.19] Between Pompey's and Caesar's
camp there was only the river Apsus, and the soldiers frequently conversed
with each other;
and by a private arrangement among themselves, no weapons were thrown
during their conferences. Caesar sent Publius Vatinius, one of his lieutenants,
to the bank of the river, to make such proposals as should appear most
conducive to peace; and to cry out frequently with a loud voice [asking],
"Are
citizens permitted to send deputies to citizens to treat of peace?
a concession which had been made even to fugitives on the Pyrenean mountains,
and to
robbers, especially when by so doing they would prevent citizens from
fighting against citizens." Having spoken much in humble language, as became
a
man pleading for his own and the general safety and being listened
to with silence by the soldiers of both armies, he received an answer from
the enemy's
party that Aulus Varro proposed coming the next day to a conference,
and that deputies from both sides might come without danger, and explain
their
wishes, and accordingly a fixed time was appointed for the interview.
When the deputies met the next day, a great multitude from both sides assembled,
and the expectations of every person concerning this subject were raised
very high, and their minds seemed to be eagerly disposed for peace. Titus
Labienus walked forward from the crowd, and in submissive terms began
to speak of peace, and to argue with Vatinius. But their conversation was
suddenly interrupted by darts thrown from all sides, from which Vatinius
escaped by being protected by the arms of the soldiers. However, several
were
wounded; and among them Cornelius Balbus, Marcus Plotius, and Lucius
Tiburtius, centurions, and some privates; hereupon Labienus exclaimed,
"Forbear, then, to speak any more about an accommodation, for we can
have no peace unless we carry Caesar's head back with us."
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.20": [3.20] At the same time in Rome,
Marcus Caelius Rufus, one of the praetors, having undertaken the cause
of the debtors, on entering
into his office, fixed his tribunal near the bench of Caius Trebonius,
the city praetor, and promised if any person appealed to him in regard
to the valuation
and payment of debts made by arbitration, as appointed by Caesar when
in Rome, that he would relieve them. But it happened, from the justice
of
Trebonius's decrees and his humanity (for he thought that in such dangerous
times justice should be administered with moderation and compassion), that
not one could be found who would offer himself the first to lodge an
appeal. For to plead poverty, to complain of his own private calamities,
or the general
distresses of the times, or to assert the difficulty of setting the
goods to sale, is the behavior of a man even of a moderate temper; but
to retain their
possessions entire, and at the same time acknowledge themselves in
debt, what sort of spirit, and what impudence would it not have argued!
Therefore
nobody was found so unreasonable as to make such demands. But Caelius
proved more severe to those very persons for whose advantage it had been
designed; and starting from this beginning, in order that he might
not appear to have engaged in so dishonorable an affair without effecting
something, he
promulgated a law that all debts should be discharged in six equal
payments, of six months each, without interest.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.21": [3.21] When Servilius, the consul,
and the other magistrates opposed him, and he himself effected less than
he expected, in order to
raise the passions of the people, he dropped it, and promulgated two
others; one, by which he remitted the annual rents of the houses to the
tenants, the
other, an act of insolvency: upon which the mob made an assault on
Caius Trebonius, and having wounded several persons, drove him from his
tribunal.
The consul Servilius informed the senate of his proceedings, who passed
a decree that Caelius should be removed from the management of the republic.
Upon this decree, the consul forbade him the senate; and when he was
attempting to harangue the people, turned him out of the rostrum. Stung
with the
ignominy and with resentment, he pretended in public that he would
go to Caesar, but privately sent messengers to Milo, who had murdered Clodius,
and
had been condemned for it; and having invited him into Italy, because
he had engaged the remains of the gladiators to his interest, by making
them ample
presents, he joined him, and sent him to Thurinum to tamper with the
shepherds. When he himself was on his road to Casilinum, at the same time
that his
military standards and arms were seized at Capua, his slaves seen at
Naples, and the design of betraying the town discovered: his plots being
revealed,
and Capua shut against him, being apprehensive of danger, because the
Roman citizens residing there had armed themselves, and thought he ought
to be
treated as an enemy to the state, he abandoned his first design, and
changed his route.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.22": [3.22] Milo in the mean time dispatched
letters to the free towns, purporting that he acted as he did by the orders
and commands of
Pompey, conveyed to him by Bibulus: and he endeavored to engage in
his interest all persons whom he imagined were under difficulties by reason
of their
debts. But not being able to prevail with them, he set at liberty some
slaves from the work-houses, and began to assault Cosa in the district
of Thurinum.
There having received a blow of a stone thrown from the wall of the
town which was commanded by Quintus Pedius with one legion, he died of
it; and
Caelius having set out, as he pretended for Caesar, went to Thurii,
where he was put to death as he was tampering with some of the freemen
of the town,
and was offering money to Caesar's Gallic and Spanish horse, which
he had sent there to strengthen the garrison. And thus these mighty beginnings,
which
had embroiled Italy, and kept the magistrates employed, found a speedy
and happy issue.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.23": [3.23] Libo having sailed from Oricum,
with a fleet of fifty ships, which he commanded, came to Brundusium, and
seized an island,
which lies opposite to the harbor; judging it better to guard that
place, which was our only pass to sea, than to keep all the shores and
ports blocked up
by a fleet. By his sudden arrival, he fell in with some of our transports,
and set them on fire, and carried off one laden with corn; he struck great
terror into
our men, and having in the night landed a party of soldiers and archers,
he beat our guard of horse from their station, and gained so much by the
advantage
of situation, that he dispatched letters to Pompey, and if he pleased
he might order the rest of the ships to be hauled upon shore and repaired;
for that with
his own fleet he could prevent Caesar from receiving his auxiliaries.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.24": [3.24] Antonius was at this time
at Brundusium, and relying on the valor of his troops, covered about sixty
of the long-boats belonging
to the men-of-war with penthouses and bulwarks of hurdles, and put
on board them select soldiers; and disposed them separately along the shore:
and
under the pretext of keeping the seamen in exercise, he ordered two
three-banked galleys, which he had built at Brundusium, to row to the mouth
of the
port. When Libo saw them advancing boldly toward him, he sent five
four-banked galleys against them, in hopes of intercepting them. When these
came
near our ships, our veteran soldiers retreated within the harbor. The
enemy, urged by their eagerness to capture them, pursued them unguardedly:
for
instantly the boats of Antonius, on a certain signal, rowed with great
violence from all parts against the enemy; and at the first charge took
one of the
four-banked galleys, with the seamen and marines, and forced the rest
to flee disgracefully. In addition to this loss, they were prevented from
getting water
by the horse which Antonius had disposed along the sea-coast. Libo,
vexed at the distress and disgrace, departed from Brundusium, and abandoned
the
blockade.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.25": [3.25] Several months had now elapsed,
and winter was almost gone, and Caesar's legions and shipping were not
coming to him from
Brundusium, and he imagined that some opportunities had been neglected,
for the winds had at least been often favorable, and he thought that he
must
trust to them at last. And the longer it was deferred, the more eager
were those who commanded Pompey's fleet to guard the coast, and were more
confident of preventing our getting assistance: they received frequent
reproofs from Pompey by letter, that as they had not prevented Caesar's
arrival at
the first, they should at least stop the remainder of his army: and
they were expecting that the season for transporting troops, would become
more
unfavorable every day, as the winds grew calmer. Caesar, feeling some
trouble on this account, wrote in severe terms to his officers at Brundusium,
[and
gave them orders] that as soon as they found the wind to answer, they
should not let the opportunity of setting sail pass by, if they were even
to steer their
course to the shore of Apollonia: because there they might run their
ships on ground. That these parts principally were left unguarded by the
enemy's fleet,
because they dare not venture too far from the harbor.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.26": [3.26] They [his officers], exerting
boldness and courage, aided by the instructions of Marcus Antonius, and
Fusius Kalenus, and
animated by the soldiers strongly encouraging them, and declining no
danger for Caesar's safety, having got a southerly wind, weighed anchor,
and the
next day were carried past Apollonia and Dyrrachium, and being seen
from the continent, Quintus Coponius, who commanded the Rhodian fleet at
Dyrrachium, put out of the port with his ships; and when they had almost
come up with us, in consequence of the breeze dying away, the south wind
sprang up afresh, and rescued us. However, he did not desist from his
attempt, but hoped by the labor and perseverance of his seamen to be able
to bear
up against the violence of the storm; and although we were carried
beyond Dyrrachium, by the violence of the wind, he nevertheless continued
to chase
us. Our men, taking advantage of fortune's kindness, for they were
still afraid of being attacked by the enemy's fleet, if the wind abated,
having come near
a port, called Nymphaeum, about three miles beyond Lissus, put into
it (this port is protected from a south-west wind, but is not secure against
a south
wind); and thought less danger was to be apprehended from the storm
than from the enemy. But as soon as they were within the port, the south
wind,
which had blown for two days, by extraordinary good luck veered round
to the south-west.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.27": [3.27] Here one might observe the
sudden turns of fortune. We who, a moment before, were alarmed for ourselves,
were safely
lodged in a very secure harbor: and they who had threatened ruin to
our fleet, were forced to be uneasy on their own account: and thus, by
a change of
circumstances, the storm protected our ships, and damaged the Rhodian
fleet to such a degree that all their decked ships, sixteen in number,
foundered,
without exception, and were wrecked: and of the prodigious number of
seamen and soldiers, some lost their lives by being dashed against the
rocks,
others were taken by our men: but Caesar sent them all safe home.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.28": [3.28] Two of our ships, that had
not kept up with the rest, being overtaken by the night, and not knowing
what port the rest had
made to, came to an anchor opposite Lissus. Otacilius Crassus, who
commanded Pompey's fleet, detached after them several barges and small
craft, and
attempted to take them. At the same time, he treated with them about
capitulating, and promised them their lives if they would surrender. One
of them
carried two hundred and twenty recruits, the other was manned with
somewhat less than two hundred veterans. Here it might be seen what security
men
derive from a resolute spirit. For the recruits, frightened at the
number of vessels, and fatigued with the rolling of the sea, and with sea-sickness,
surrendered to Otacilius, after having first received his oath, that
the enemy would not injure them; but as soon as they were brought before
him, contrary
to the obligation of his oath, they were inhumanly put to death in
his presence. But the soldiers of the veteran legion, who had also struggled,
not only with
the inclemency of the weather, but by laboring at the pump, thought
it their duty to remit nothing of their former valor: and having protracted
the beginning
of the night in settling the terms, under pretense of surrendering,
they obliged the pilot to run the ship aground: and having got a convenient
place on the
shore, they spent the rest of the night there, and at day-break, when
Otacilius had sent against them a party of the horse, who guarded that
part of the
coast, to the number of four hundred, beside some armed men, who had
followed them from the garrison, they made a brave defense, and having
killed
some of them, retreated in safety to our army.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.29": [3.29] After this action, the Roman
citizens, who resided at Lissus, a town which Caesar had before assigned
them, and had carefully
fortified, received Antony into their town, and gave him every assistance.
Otacilius, apprehensive for his own safety, escaped out of the town, and
went to
Pompey. All his forces, whose number amounted to three veteran legions,
and one of recruits, and about eight hundred horse being landed, Antony
sent
most of his ships back to Italy, to transport the remainder of the
soldiers and horse. The pontons, which are a sort of Gallic ships, he left
at Lissus with this
object, that if Pompey, imagining Italy defenseless, should transport
his army thither (and this notion was spread among the common people),
Caesar
might have some means of pursuing him; and he sent messengers to him
with great dispatch, to inform him in what part of the country he had landed
his
army, and what number of troops he had brought over with him.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.30": [3.30] Caesar and Pompey received
this intelligence almost at the same time; for they had seen the ships
sail past Apollonia and
Dyrrachium. They directed their march after them by land; but at first
they were ignorant to what part they had been carried; but when they were
informed
of it, they each adopted a different plan; Caesar, to form a junction
with Antonius as soon as possible; Pompey, to oppose Antonius's forces
on their
march to Caesar, and, if possible, to fall upon them unexpectedly from
ambush. And the same day they both led out their armies from their winter
encampment along the river Apsus; Pompey, privately by night; Caesar,
openly by day. But Caesar had to march a longer circuit up the river to
find a
ford. Pompey's route being easy, because he was not obliged to cross
the river, he advanced rapidly and by forced marches against Antonius,
and being
informed of his approach, chose a convenient situation, where he posted
his forces; and kept his men close within camp, and forbade fires to be
kindled,
that his arrival might be the more secret. An account of this was immediately
carried to Antonius by the Greeks. He dispatched messengers to Caesar,
and
confined himself in his camp for one day. The next day Caesar, came
up with him. On learning his arrival, Pompey, to prevent his being hemmed
in
between two armies, quitted his position, and went with all his forces
to Asparagium, in the territory of Dyrrachium, and there encamped in a
convenient
situation.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.31": [3.31] During these times, Scipio,
though he had sustained some losses near mount Amanus, had assumed to himself
the title of
imperator, after which he demanded large sums of money from the states
and princes. He had also exacted from the tax-gatherers, two years' rents
that
they owed; and enjoined them to lend him the amount of the next year,
and demanded a supply of horse from the whole province. When they were
collected, leaving behind him his neighboring enemies, the Parthians
(who shortly before had killed Marcus Crassus, the imperator, and had kept
Marcus
Bibulus besieged), he drew his legions and cavalry out of Syria; and
when he came into the province, which was under great anxiety and fear
of the
Parthian war, and heard some declarations of the soldiers, "That they
would march against an enemy, if he would lead them on; but would never
bear
arms against a countryman and consul;" he drew off his legions to winter
quarters to Pergamus, and the most wealthy cities, and made them rich presents:
and in order to attach them more firmly to his interest, permitted
them to plunder the cities.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.32": [3.32] In the mean time, the money
which had been demanded from the province at large, was most vigorously
exacted. Besides,
many new imposts of different kinds were devised to gratify his avarice.
A tax of so much a head was laid on every slave and child. Columns, doors,
corn,
soldiers, sailors, arms, engines, and carriages, were made subject
to a duty. Wherever a name could be found for any thing, it was deemed
a sufficient
reason for levying money on it. Officers were appointed to collect
it, not only in the cities, but in almost every village and fort: and whosoever
of them
acted with the greatest rigor and inhumanity, was esteemed the best
man, and best citizen. The province was overrun with bailiffs and officers,
and
crowded with overseers and tax-gatherers; who, besides the duties imposed,
exacted a gratuity for themselves; for they asserted, that being expelled
from
their own homes and countries, they stood in need of every necessary;
endeavoring by a plausible pretense, to color the most infamous conduct.
To this
was added the most exorbitant interest, as usually happens in times
of war; the whole sums being called in, on which occasion, they alleged
that the delay
of a single day was a donation. Therefore, in those two years, the
debt of the province was doubled: but notwithstanding, taxes were exacted,
not only
from the Roman citizens, but from every corporation and every state.
And they said that these were loans, exacted by the senate's decree. The
taxes of
the ensuing year were demanded beforehand as a loan from the collectors,
as on their first appointment.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.33": [3.33] Moreover, Scipio ordered the
money formerly lodged in the temple of Diana at Ephesus, to be taken out
with the statues of
that goddess, which remained there. When Scipio came to the temple,
letters were delivered to him from Pompey, in the presence of several senators,
whom he had called upon to attend him; [informing him] that Caesar
had crossed the sea with his legions; that Scipio should hasten to him
with his army,
and postpone all other business. As soon as he received the letter,
he dismissed his attendants, and began to prepare for his journey to Macedonia;
and a
few days after set out. This circumstance saved the money at Ephesus.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.34": [3.34] Caesar, having effected a
junction with Antonius's army, and having drawn his legion out of Oricum,
which he had left there to
guard the coast, thought he ought to sound the inclination of the provinces,
and march further into the country; and when embassadors came to him from
Thessaly and Aetolia, to engage that the states in those countries
would obey his orders, if he sent a garrison to protect them, he dispatched
Lucius
Cassius Longinus, with the twenty-seventh, a legion composed of young
soldiers, and two hundred horse, to Thessaly: and Caius Calvisius Sabinus,
with
five cohorts, and a small party of horse, into Aetolia. He recommended
them to be especially careful to provide corn, because those regions were
nearest
to him. He ordered Cneius Domitius Calvinus to march into Macedonia
with two legions, the eleventh and twelfth, and five hundred horse; from
which
province, Menedemus, the principal man of those regions, on that side
which is called the Free, having come as embassador, assured him of the
most
devoted affection of all his subjects.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.35": [3.35] Of these Calvisius, on his
first arrival in Aetolia, being very kindly received, dislodged the enemy's
garrisons in Calydon and
Naupactus, and made himself master of the whole country. Cassius went
to Thessaly with his legion. As there were two factions there, he, found
the
citizens divided in their inclinations. Hegasaretus, a man of established
power, favored Pompey's interest. Petreius, a young man of a most noble
family,
warmly supported Caesar with his own and his friends' influence.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.36": [3.36] At the same time, Domitius
arrived in Macedonia: and when numerous embassies had begun to wait on
him from many of the
states, news was brought that Scipio was approaching with his legions,
which occasioned various opinions and reports; for in strange events, rumor
generally goes before. Without making any delay in any part of Macedonia,
he marched with great haste against Domitius; and when he was come within
about twenty miles of him, wheeled on a sudden toward Cassius Longinus
in Thessaly. He effected this with such celerity, that news of his march
and
arrival came together; for to render his march expeditious, he left
the baggage of his legions behind him at the river Haliacmon, which divides
Macedonia
from Thessaly, under the care of Marcus Favonius, with a guard of eight
cohorts, and ordered him to build a strong fort there. At the same time,
Cotus's
cavalry, which used to infest the neighborhood of Macedonia, flew to
attack Cassius's camp, at which Cassius being alarmed, and having received
information of Scipio's approach, and seen the horse, which he imagined
to be Scipio's, he betook himself to the mountains that environ Thessaly,
and
thence began to make his route toward Ambracia. But when Scipio was
hastening to pursue him, dispatches overtook him from Favonius, that Domitius
was marching against him with his legions, and that he could not maintain
the garrison over which he was appointed, without Scipio's assistance.
On
receipt of these dispatches, Scipio changed his designs and his route,
desisted from his pursuit of Cassius, and hastened to relieve Favonius.
Accordingly,
continuing his march day and night, he came to him so opportunely,
that the dust raised by Domitius's army, and Scipio's advanced guard, were
observed
at the same instant. Thus, the vigilance of Domitius saved Cassius,
and the expedition of Scipio, Favonius.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.37": [3.37] Scipio, having staid for two
days in his camp, along the river Haliacmon, which ran between him and
Domitius's camp, on the
third day, at dawn, led his army across a ford, and having made a regular
encampment the day following, drew up his forces in front of his camp.
Domitius
thought he ought not to show any reluctance, but should draw out his
forces and hazard a battle. But as there was a plain six miles in breadth
between the
two camps, he posted his army before Scipio's camp; while the latter
persevered in not quitting his intrenchment. However, Domitius with difficulty
restrained his men, and prevented their beginning a battle; the more
so as a rivulet with steep banks, joining Scipio's camp, retarded the progress
of our
men. When Scipio perceived the eagerness and alacrity of our troops
to engage, suspecting that he should be obliged the next day, either to
fight, against
his inclination, or to incur great disgrace by keeping within his camp,
though he had come with high expectation, yet by advancing rashly, made
a shameful
end; and at night crossed the river, without even giving the signal
for breaking up the camp, and returned to the ground from which he came,
and there
encamped near the river, on an elevated situation. After a few days,
he placed a party of horse in ambush in the night, where our men had usually
gone to
forage for several days before. And when Quintus Varus, commander of
Domitius's horse, came there as usual, they suddenly rushed from their
ambush.
But our men bravely supported their charge, and returned quickly every
man to his own rank, and in their turn, made a general charge on the enemy;
and
having killed about eighty of them, and put the rest to flight, retreated
to their camp with the loss of only two men.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.38": [3.38] After these transactions,
Domitius, hoping to allure Scipio to a battle, pretended to be obliged
to change his position through
want of corn, and having given the signal for decamping, advanced about
three miles, and posted his army and cavalry in a convenient place, concealed
from the enemy's view. Scipio being in readiness to pursue him, detached
his cavalry and a considerable number of light infantry to explore Domitius's
route. When they had marched a short way, and their foremost troops
were within reach of our ambush, their suspicions being raised by the neighing
of
the horses, they began to retreat: and the rest who followed them,
observing with what speed they retreated, made a halt. Our men, perceiving
that the
enemy had discovered their plot, and thinking it in vain to wait for
any more, having got two troops in their power, intercepted them. Among
them was
Marcus Opimius, general of the horse, but he made his escape: they
either killed or took prisoners all the rest of these two troops, and brought
them to
Domitius.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.39": [3.39] Caesar, having drawn his garrisons
out of the sea-ports, as before mentioned, left three cohorts at Oricum
to protect the town,
and committed to them the charge of his ships of war, which he had
transported from Italy. Acilius, as lieutenant-general, had the charge
of this duty and
the command of the town; he drew the ships into the inner part of the
harbor, behind the town, and fastened them to the shore, and sank a merchant-ship
in the mouth of the harbor to block it up; and near it he fixed another
at anchor, on which he raised a turret, and faced it to the entrance of
the port, and
filled it with soldiers, and ordered them to keep guard against any
sudden attack.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.40": [3.40] Cneius, Pompey's son, who
commanded the Egyptian fleet, having got intelligence of these things,
came to Oricum, and
weighed up the ship, that had been sunk, with a windlass, and by straining
at it with several ropes, and attacked the other which had been placed
by
Acilius to watch the port with several ships, on which he had raised
very high turrets, so that fighting as it were from an eminence, and sending
fresh men
constantly to relieve the fatigued, and at the same time attempting
the town on all sides by land, with ladders and his fleet, in order to
divide the force of his
enemies, he overpowered our men by fatigue, and the immense number
of darts, and took the ship, having beat off the men that were put on board
to
defend it, who, however, made their escape in small boats; and at the,
same time he seized a natural mole on the opposite side, which almost formed
an
island over against the town. He carried over land, into the inner
part of the harbor, four galleys, by putting rollers under them, and driving
them on with
levers. Then attacking on both sides the ships of war which were moored
to the shore, and were not manned, he carried off four of them, and set
the rest
on fire. After dispatching this business, he left Decimus Laelius,
whom he had taken away from the command of the Asiatic fleet, to hinder
provisions from
being brought into the town from Biblis and Amantia, and went himself
to Lissus, where he attacked thirty merchantmen, left within the port by
Antonius,
and set them on fire. He attempted to storm Lissus, but being delayed
three days by the vigorous defense of the Roman citizens who belonged to
that
district, and of the soldiers which Caesar had sent to keep garrison
there, and having lost a few men in the assault, he returned without effecting
his object.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.41": [3.41] As soon as Caesar heard that
Pompey was at Asparagium, he set out for that place with his army, and
having taken the capital
of the Parthinians on his march, where there was a garrison of Pompey's,
he reached Pompey in Macedonia, on the third day, and encamped beside him;
and the day following having drawn out all his forces before his camp,
he offered Pompey battle. But perceiving that he kept within his trenches,
he led his
army back to his camp, and thought of pursuing some other plan. Accordingly,
the day following, he set out with all his forces by a long circuit, through
a
difficult and narrow road to Dyrrachium; hoping, either that Pompey
would be compelled to follow him to Dyrrachium, or that his communication
with it
might be cut off, because he had deposited there all his provisions
and material of war. And so it happened; for Pompey, at first not knowing
his design,
because he imagined he had taken a route in a different direction from
that country, thought that the scarcity of provisions had obliged him to
shift his
quarters; but having afterward got true intelligence from his scouts,
he decamped the day following, hoping to prevent him by taking a shorter
road; which
Caesar suspecting might happen, encouraged his troops to submit cheerfully
to the fatigue, and having halted a very small part of the night, he arrived
early
in the morning at Dyrrachium, when the van of Pompey's army was visible
at a distance, and there he encamped.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.42": [3.42] Pompey, being cut off from
Dyrrachium, as he was unable to effect his purpose, took a new resolution,
and intrenched himself
strongly on a rising ground, which is called Petra, where ships of
a small size can come in, and be sheltered from some winds. Here he ordered
a part of
his men of war to attend him, and corn and provisions to be brought
from Asia, and from all the countries of which he kept possession. Caesar,
imagining
that the war would be protracted to too great a length, and despairing
of his convoys from Italy, because all the coasts were guarded with great
diligence
by Pompey's adherents; and because his own fleets, which he had built
during the winter, in Sicily, Gaul, and Italy, were detained; sent Lucius
Canuleius
into Epirus to procure corn; and because these countries were too remote,
he fixed granaries in certain places, and regulated the carriage of the
corn for
the neighboring states. He likewise gave directions that search should
be made for whatever corn was in Lissus, the country of the Parthini, and
all the
places of strength. The quantity was very small, both from the nature
of the land (for the country is rough and mountainous, and the people commonly
import what grain they use); and because Pompey had foreseen what would
happen, and some days before had plundered the Parthini, and having
ravaged and dug up their houses, carried off all the corn, which he
collected by means of his horse.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.43": [3.43] Caesar, on being informed
of these transactions, pursued measures suggested by the nature of the
country. For round
Pompey's camps there were several high and rough hills. These he first
of all occupied with guards, and raised strong forts on them. Then drawing
a
fortification from one fort to another, as the nature of each position
allowed, he began to draw a line of circumvallation round Pompey, with
these views;
as he had but a small quantity of corn, and Pompey was strong in cavalry,
that he might furnish his army with corn and other necessaries from all
sides with
less danger; secondly, to prevent Pompey from foraging, and thereby
render his horse ineffectual in the operations of the war; and thirdly,
to lessen his
reputation, on which he saw he depended greatly, among foreign nations,
when a report should have spread throughout the world that he was blockaded
by Caesar, and dare not hazard a battle.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.44": [3.44] Neither was Pompey willing
to leave the sea and Dyrrachium, because he had lodged his material there,
his weapons, arms,
and engines; and supplied his army with corn from it by his ships;
nor was he able to put a stop to Caesar's works without hazarding a battle,
which at that
time he had determined not to do. Nothing was left but to adopt the
last resource, namely, to possess himself of as many hills as he could,
and cover as
great an extent of country as possible with his troops, and divide
Caesar's forces as much as possible; and so it happened: for having raised
twenty-four
forts, and taken in a compass of fifteen miles, he got forage in this
space, and within this circuit there were several fields lately sown, in
which the cattle
might feed in the mean time. And as our men, who had completed their
works by drawing lines of communication from one fort to another, were
afraid
that Pompey's men would sally out from some part, and attack us in
the rear; so the enemy were making a continued fortification in a circuit
within ours to
prevent us from breaking in on any side, or surrounding them on the
rear. But they completed their works first; both because they had a greater
number of
men, and because they had a smaller compass to inclose. When Caesar
attempted to gain any place, though Pompey had resolved not to oppose him
with
his whole force, or to come to a general engagement, yet he detached
to particular places slingers and archers, with which his army abounded,
and several
of our men were wounded, and filled with great dread of the arrows;
and almost all the soldiers made coats or coverings for themselves of hair
cloths,
tarpaulins, or raw hides to defend them against the weapons.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.45": [3.45] In seizing the posts, each
exerted his utmost power. Caesar, to confine Pompey within as narrow a
compass as possible;
Pompey, to occupy as many hills as he could in as large a circuit as
possible, and several skirmishes were fought in consequence of it. In one
of these,
when Caesar's ninth legion had gained a certain post, and had begun
to fortify it, Pompey possessed himself of a hill near to and opposite
the same place,
and endeavored to annoy the men while at work; and as the approach
on one side was almost level, he first surrounded it with archers and slingers,
and
afterward by detaching a strong party of light infantry, and using
his engines, he stopped our works; and it was no easy matter for our men
at once to
defend themselves, and to proceed with their fortifications. When Caesar
perceived that his troops were wounded from all sides, he determined to
retreat
and give up the post; his retreat was down a precipice, on which account
they pushed on with more spirit, and would not allow us to retire, because
they
imagined that we resigned the place through fear. It is reported that
Pompey said that day in triumph to his friends about him, "That he would
consent to
be accounted a general of no experience, if Caesar's legions effected
a retreat without considerable loss from that ground into which they had
rashly
advanced."
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.46": [3.46] Caesar, being uneasy about
the retreat of his soldiers, ordered hurdles to be carried to the further
side of the hill, and to be
placed opposite to the enemy, and behind them a trench of a moderate
breadth to be sunk by his soldiers under shelter of the hurdles; and the
ground to
be made as difficult as possible. He himself disposed slingers in convenient
places to cover our men in their retreat. These things being completed,
he
ordered his legions to file off: Pompey's men insultingly and boldly
pursued and chased us, leveling the hurdles that were thrown up in the
front of our
works, in order to pass over the trench. Which as soon as Caesar perceived,
being afraid that his men would appear not to retreat, but to be repulsed,
and that greater loss might be sustained, when his men were almost
half way down the hill, he encouraged them by Antonius, who commanded that
legion,
ordered the signal of battle to be sounded, and a charge to be made
on the enemy. The soldiers of the ninth legion suddenly closing their files,
threw their
javelins, and advancing impetuously from the low ground up the steep,
drove Pompey's men precipitately before them, and obliged them to turn
their
backs; but their retreat was greatly impeded by the hurdles that lay
in a long line before them, and the palisadoes which were in their way,
and the trenches
that were sunk. But our men being contented to retreat without injury,
having killed several of the enemy, and lost but five of their own, very
quietly
retired, and having seized some other hills somewhat on this side of
that place, completed their fortifications.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.47": [3.47] This method of conducting
a war was new and unusual, as well on account of the number of forts, the
extent and greatness of
the works, and the manner of attack and defense, as on account of other
circumstances. For all who have attempted to besiege any person, have attacked
the enemy when they were frightened or weak, or after a defeat; or
have been kept in fear of some attack, when they themselves have had a
superior
force both of foot and horse. Besides, the usual design of a siege
is to cut off the enemy's supplies. On the contrary, Caesar, with an inferior
force, was
inclosing troops sound and unhurt, and who had abundance of all things.
For there arrived every day a prodigious number of ships, which brought
them
provisions: nor could the wind blow from any point, that would not
be favorable to some of them. Whereas, Caesar, having consumed all the
corn far and
near, was in very great distress, but his soldiers bore all with uncommon
patience. For they remembered that they lay under the same difficulties
last year
in Spain, and yet by labor and patience had concluded a dangerous war.
They recollected too that they had suffered an alarming scarcity at Alesia,
and a
much greater at Avaricum, and yet had returned victorious over mighty
nations. They refused neither barley nor pulse when offered them, and they
held in
great esteem cattle, of which they got great quantities from Epirus.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.48": [3.48] There was a sort of root called
chara, discovered by the troops which served under Valerius. This they
mixed up with milk, and
it greatly contributed to relieve their want. They made it into a sort
of bread. They had great plenty of it; loaves made of this, when Pompey's
men
upbraided ours with want, they frequently threw among them to damp
their hopes.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.49": [3.49] The corn was now beginning
to ripen, and their hope supported their want, as they were confident of
having abundance in a
short time. And there were frequently heard declarations of the soldiers
on guard, in discourse with each other, that they would rather live on
the bark of
the trees, than let Pompey escape from their hands. For they were often
told by deserters, that they could scarcely maintain their horses, and
that their
other cattle was dead: that they themselves were not in good health
from their confinement within so narrow a compass, from the noisome smell,
the
number of carcasses, and the constant fatigue to them, being men unaccustomed
to work, and laboring under a great want of water. For Caesar had either
turned the course of all the rivers and streams which ran to the sea,
or had dammed them up with strong works. And as the country was mountainous,
and
the valleys narrow at the bottom, he inclosed them with piles sunk
in the ground, and heaped up mold against them to keep in the water. They
were
therefore obliged to search for low and marshy grounds, and to sink
wells, and they had this labor in addition to their daily works. And even
these springs
were at a considerable distance from some of their posts, and soon
dried up with the heat. But Caesar's army enjoyed perfect health and abundance
of
water, and had plenty of all sorts of provisions except corn; and they
had a prospect of better times approaching, and saw greater hopes laid
before them
by the ripening of the grain.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.50": [3.50] In this new kind of war, new
methods of managing it were invented by both generals. Pompey's men, perceiving
by our fires at
night, at what part of the works our cohorts were on guard, coming
silently upon them discharged their arrows at random among the whole multitude,
and
instantly retired to their camp; as a remedy against which our men
were taught by experience to light their fires in one place, and keep guard
in
another.Note: The translator felt that some of the original text was
missing at this point.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.51": [3.51] In the mean time, Publius
Sylla, whom Caesar at his departure had left governor of his camp, came
up with two legions to assist
the cohort; upon whose arrival Pompey's forces were easily repulsed.
Nor did they stand the sight and charge of our men, and the foremost falling,
the
rest turned their backs and quitted the field. But Sylla called our
men in from the pursuit, lest their ardor should carry them too far, but
most people
imagine that if he had consented to a vigorous pursuit, the war might
have been ended that day. His conduct however does not appear to deserve
censure;
for the duties of a lieutenant-general, and of a commander-in-chief,
are very different; the one is bound to act entirely according to his instructions,
the
other to regulate his conduct without control, as occasion requires.
Sylla, being deputed by Caesar to take care of the camp, and having rescued
his men,
was satisfied with that, and did not desire to hazard a battle (although
this circumstance might probably have had a successful issue), that he
might not be
thought to have assumed the part of the general. One circumstance laid
the Pompeians under great difficulty in making good a retreat: for they
had
advanced from disadvantageous ground, and were posted on the top of
a hill. If they attempted to retire down the steep, they dreaded the pursuit
of our
men from the rising ground, and there was but a short time till sunset:
for in hopes of completing the business, they had protracted the battle
almost till
night. Taking therefore measures suited to their exigency, and to the
shortness of the time, Pompey possessed himself of an eminence, at such
a distance
from our fort that no weapon discharged from an engine could reach
him. Here he took up a position, and fortified it, and kept all his forces
there.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.52": [3.52] At the same time, there were
engagements in two other places; for Pompey had attacked several forts
at once, in order to
divide our forces; that no relief might be sent from the neighboring
posts. In one place, Volcatius Tullus sustained the charge of a legion
with three cohorts,
and beat them off the field. In another, the Germans, having sallied
over our fortifications, slew several of the enemy, and retreated safe
to our camp.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.53": [3.53] Thus six engagements having
happened in one day, three at Dyrrachium, and three at the fortifications,
when a computation was
made of the number of slain, we found that about two thousand fell
on Pompey's side, several of them volunteer veterans and centurions. Among
them
was Valerius, the son of Lucius Flaccus, who as praetor had formerly
had the government of Asia, and six military standards were taken. Of our
men, not
more than twenty were missing in all the action. But in the fort, not
a single soldier escaped without a wound; and in one cohort, four centurions
lost their
eyes. And being desirous to produce testimony of the fatigue they under
went, and the danger they sustained, they counted to Caesar about thirty
thousand arrows which had been thrown into the fort; and in the shield
of the centurion Scaeva, which was brought to him, were found two hundred
and
thirty holes. In reward for this man's services, both to himself and
the public, Caesar presented to him two hundred thousand pieces of copper
money, and
declared him promoted from the eighth to the first centurion. For it
appeared that the fort had been in a great measure saved by his exertions;
and he
afterward very amply rewarded the cohorts with double pay, corn, clothing,
and other military honors.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.54": [3.54] Pompey, having made great
additions to his works in the night, the following days built turrets,
and having carried his works
fifteen feet high, faced that part of his camp with mantelets; and
after an interval of five days, taking advantage of a second cloudy night,
he barricaded all
the gates of his camp to hinder a pursuit, and about midnight, quietly
marched off his army, and retreated to his old fortifications.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.55": [3.55] Aetolia, Acarnania, and Amphilochis,
being reduced, as we have related, by Cassius Longinus, and Calvisius Sabinus,
Caesar
thought he ought to attempt the conquest of Achaia, and to advance
further into the country. Accordingly, he detached Fufius thither, and
ordered Quintus
Sabinus and Cassius to join him with their cohorts. Upon notice of
their approach, Rutilius Lupus, who commanded in Achaia, under Pompey,
began to
fortify the Isthmus, to prevent Fufius from coming into Achaia. Kalenus
recovered Delphi, Thebes, and Orchomenus, by a voluntary submission of
those
states. Some he subdued by force, the rest he endeavored to win over
to Caesar's interest, by sending deputies round to them. In these things,
principally,
Fusius was employed.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.56": [3.56] Every day afterward, Caesar
drew up his army on a level ground, and offered Pompey battle, and led
his legions almost close
to Pompey's camp; and his front line was at no greater distance from
the rampart than that no weapon from their engines could reach it. But
Pompey, to
save his credit and reputation with the world, drew out his legions,
but so close to his camp, that his rear line might touch the rampart, and
that his whole
army, when drawn up, might be protected by the darts discharged from
it.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.57": [3.57] While these things were going
forward in Achaia and at Dyrrachium, and when it was certainly known that
Scipio was arrived
in Macedonia, Caesar, never losing sight of his first intention, sends
Clodius to him, an intimate friend to both, whom Caesar, on the introduction
and
recommendation of Pompey, had admitted into the number of his acquaintance.
To this man he gave letters and instructions to Pompey, the substance of
which was as follows: "That he had made every effort toward peace,
and imputed the ill success of those efforts to the fault of those whom
he had
employed to conduct those negotiations; because they were afraid to
carry his proposals to Pompey at an improper time. That Scipio had such
authority,
that he could not only freely explain what conduct met his approbation,
but even in some degree enforce his advice, and govern him [Pompey] if
he
persisted in error; that he commanded an army independent of Pompey,
so that besides his authority, he had strength to compel; and if he did
so, all men
would be indebted to him for the quiet of Italy, the peace of the provinces,
and the preservation of the empire." These proposals Clodius made to him,
and
for some days at the first appeared to have met with a favorable reception,
but afterward was not admitted to an audience; for Scipio being reprimanded
by Favonius, as we found afterward when the war was ended, and the
negotiation having miscarried, Clodius returned to Caesar.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.58": [3.58] Caesar, that he might the
more easily keep Pompey's horse inclosed within Dyrrachium, and prevent
them from foraging,
fortified the two narrow passes already mentioned with strong works,
and erected forts at them. Pompey perceiving that he derived no advantage
from his
cavalry, after a few days had them conveyed back to his camp by sea.
Fodder was so exceedingly scarce that he was obliged to feed his horses
upon
leaves stripped off the trees, or the tender roots of reeds pounded.
For the corn which had been sown within the lines was already consumed,
and they
would be obliged to supply themselves with fodder from Corcyra and
Acarnania, over a long tract of sea; and as the quantity of that fell short,
to increase
it by mixing barley with it, and by these methods support their cavalry.
But when not only the barley and fodder in these parts were consumed, and
the
herbs cut away, when the leaves too were not to be found on the trees,
the horses being almost starved, Pompey thought he ought to make some attempt
by a sally.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.59": [3.59] In the number of Caesar's
cavalry were two Allobrogians, brothers, named Roscillus and Aegus, the
sons of Abducillus, who
for several years possessed the chief power in his own state; men of
singular valor, whose gallant services Caesar had found very useful in
all his wars in
Gaul. To them, for these reasons, he had committed the offices of greatest
honor in their own country, and took care to have them chosen into the
senate
at an unusual age, and had bestowed on them lands taken from the enemy,
and large pecuniary rewards, and from being needy had made them affluent.
Their valor had not only procured them Caesar's esteem, but they were
beloved by the whole army. But presuming on Caesar's friendship, and elated
with
the arrogance natural to a foolish and barbarous people, they despised
their countrymen, defrauded their cavalry of their pay, and applied all
the plunder
to their own use. Displeased at this conduct, their soldiers went in
a body to Caesar, and openly complained of their ill usage; and to their
other charges
added, that false musters were given in to Caesar, and the surcharged
pay applied to their own use.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.60": [3.60] Caesar, not thinking it a
proper time to call them to account, and willing to pardon many faults,
on account of their valor,
deferred the whole matter, and gave them a private rebuke, for having
made a traffic of their troops, and advised them to expect every thing
from his
friendship, and by his past favors to measure their future hopes. This
however, gave them great offense, and made them contemptible in the eyes
of the
whole army. Of this they became sensible, as well from the reproaches
of others, as from the judgment of their own minds, and a consciousness
of guilt.
Prompted then by shame, and perhaps imagining that they were not liberated
from trial, but reserved to a future day, they resolved to break off from
us, to
put their fortune to a new hazard, and to make trial of new connections.
And having conferred with a few of their clients, to whom they could venture
to
intrust so base an action, they first attempted to assassinate Caius
Volusenus, general of the horse (as was discovered at the end of the war),
that they
might appear to have fled to Pompey after conferring an important service
on him. But when that appeared too difficult to put in execution, and no
opportunity offered to accomplish it, they borrowed all the money they
could, as if they designed to make satisfaction and restitution for what
they had
defrauded: and having purchased a great number of horses, they deserted
to Pompey along with those whom they had engaged in their plot.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.61": [3.61] As they were persons nobly
descended and of liberal education, and had come with a great retinue,
and several cattle, and
were reckoned men of courage, and had been in great esteem with Caesar,
and as it was a new and uncommon event, Pompey carried them round all his
works, and made an ostentatious show of them, for till that day, not
a soldier, either horse or foot had deserted from Caesar to Pompey, though
there
were desertions almost every day from Pompey to Caesar: but more commonly
among the soldiers levied in Epirus and Aetolia, and in those countries,
which were in Caesar's possession. But the brothers, having been acquainted
with all things, either what was incomplete in our works, or what appeared
to the best judges of military matters to be deficient, the particular
times, the distance of places, and the various attention of the guards,
according to the
different temper and character of the officer who commanded the different
posts, gave an exact account of all to Pompey.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.62": [3.62] Upon receiving this intelligence,
Pompey, who had already formed the design of attempting a sally, as before
mentioned,
ordered the soldiers to make ozier coverings for their helmets, and
to provide fascines. These things being prepared, he embarked on board
small boats
and row galleys by night, a considerable number of light infantry and
archers, with all their fascines, and immediately after midnight, he marched
sixty
cohorts drafted from the greater camp and the outposts, to that part
of our works which extended toward the sea, and were at the furthest distance
from
Caesar's greater camp. To the same place he sent the ships, which he
had freighted with the fascines and light-armed troops; and all the ships
of war that
lay at Dyrrachium; and to each he gave particular instructions: at
this part of the lines Caesar had posted Lentulus Marcellinus, the quaestor,
with the ninth
legion, and as he was not in a good state of health, Fulvius Costhumus
was sent to assist him in the command.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.63": [3.63] At this place, fronting the
enemy, there was a ditch fifteen feet wide, and a rampart ten feet high,
and the top of the rampart was
ten feet in breadth. At an interval of six hundred feet from that there
was another rampart turned the contrary way, with the works lower. For
some days
before, Caesar, apprehending that our men might be surrounded by sea,
had made a double rampart there, that if he should be attacked on both
sides, he
might have the means of defending himself. But the extent of the lines,
and the incessant labor for so many days, because he had inclosed a circuit
of
seventeen miles with his works, did not allow time to finish them.
Therefore the transverse rampart which should make a communication between
the other
two, was not yet completed. This circumstance was known to Pompey,
being told to him by the Allobrogian deserters, and proved of great disadvantage
to us. For when our cohorts of the ninth legion were on guard by the
sea-side, Pompey's army arrived suddenly by break of day, and their approach
was
a surprise to our men, and at the same time, the soldiers that came
by sea, cast their darts on the front rampart; and the ditches were filled
with fascines:
and the legionary soldiers terrified those that defended the inner
rampart, by applying the scaling ladders, and by engines and weapons of
all sorts, and a
vast multitude of archers poured round upon them from every side. Besides,
the coverings of oziers, which they had laid over their helmets, were a
great
security to them against the blows of stones which were the only weapons
that our soldiers had. And therefore, when our men were oppressed in every
manner, and were scarcely able to make resistance, the defect in our
works was observed, and Pompey's soldiers, landing between the two ramparts,
where the work was unfinished, attacked our men in the rear, and having
beat them from both sides of the fortification, obliged them to flee.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.64": [3.64] Marcellinus, being informed
of this disorder, detached some cohorts to the relief of our men, who seeing
them flee from the
camp, were neither able to persuade them to rally at their approach,
nor themselves to sustain the enemy's charge. And in like manner, whatever
additional
assistance was sent, was infected by the fears of the defeated, and
increased the terror and danger. For retreat was prevented by the multitude
of the
fugitives. In that battle, when the eagle-bearer was dangerously wounded,
and began to grow weak, having got sight of our horse, he said to them,
"This
eagle have I defended with the greatest care for many years, at the
hazard of my life, and now in my last moments restore it to Caesar with
the same
fidelity. Do not, I conjure you, suffer a dishonor to be sustained
in the field, which never before happened to Caesar's army, but deliver
it safe into his
hands." By this accident the eagle was preserved, but all the centurions
of the first cohorts were killed, except the principal.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.65": [3.65] And now the Pompeians, after
great havoc of our troops, were approaching Marcellinus's camp, and had
struck no small terror
into the rest of the cohorts, when Marcus Antonius, who commanded the
nearest fort, being informed of what had happened, was observed descending
from the rising ground with twelve cohorts. His arrival checked the
Pompeians, and encouraged our men to recover from their extreme affright.
And
shortly after, Caesar having got notice by the smoke of all the forts,
which was the usual signal on such occasions, drafted off some cohorts
from the
outposts, and went to the scene of action. And having there learned
the loss he had sustained, and perceiving that Pompey had forced our works,
and had
encamped along the coast, so that he was at liberty to forage, and
had a communication with his shipping, he altered his plan for conducting
the war, as his
design had not succeeded, and ordered a strong encampment to be made
near Pompey.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.66": [3.66] When this work was finished,
Caesar's scouts observed that some cohorts, which to them appeared like
a legion, were retired
behind the wood, and were on their march to the old camp. The situation
of the two camps was as follows: a few days before, when Caesar's ninth
legion
had opposed a party of Pompey's troops, and were endeavoring to inclose
them, Caesar's troops formed a camp in that place. This camp joined a certain
wood, and was not above four hundred paces distant from the sea. Afterward,
changing his design for certain reasons, Caesar removed his camp to a
small distance beyond that place; and after a few days, Pompey took
possession of it, and added more extensive works, leaving the inner rampart
standing, as he intended to keep several legions there. By this means,
the lesser camp, included within the greater, answered the purpose of a
fort and
citadel. He had also carried an intrenchment from the left angle of
the camp to the river, about four hundred paces, that his soldiers might
have more liberty
and less danger in fetching water. But he too, changing his design
for reasons not necessary to be mentioned, abandoned the place. In this
condition the
camp remained for several days, the works being all entire.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.67": [3.67] Caesar's scouts brought him
word that the standard of a legion was carried to this place. That the
same thing was seen he was
assured by those in the higher forts. This place was a half a mile
distant from Pompey's new camp. Caesar, hoping to surprise this legion,
and anxious to
repair the loss sustained that day, left two cohorts employed in the
works to make an appearance of intrenching himself, and by a different
route, as
privately as he could, with his other cohorts amounting to thirty-three,
among which was the ninth legion, which had lost so many centurions, and
whose
privates were greatly reduced in number, he marched in two lines against
Pompey's legion and his lesser camp. Nor did this first opinion deceive
him. For
he reached the place before Pompey could have notice of it; and though
the works were strong, yet having made the attack with the left wing which
he
commanded in person, he obliged the Pompeians to quit the rampart in
disorder. A barricade had been raised before the gates, at which a short
contest
was maintained, our men endeavoring to force their way in, and the
enemy to defend the camp; Titus Pulcio, by whose means we have related
that Caius
Antonius's army was betrayed, defending them with singular courage.
But the valor of our men prevailed, and having cut down the barricade,
they first
forced the greater camp, and after that the fort which was inclosed
within it; and as the legion on its repulse had retired to this, they slew
several defending
themselves there.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.68": [3.68] But Fortune who exerts a powerful
influence as well in other matters, as especially in war, effects great
changes from trifling
causes, as happened at this time. For the cohorts on Caesar's right
wing, through ignorance of the place, followed the direction of that rampart
which ran
along from the camp to the river, while they were in search of a gate,
and imagined that it belonged to the camp. But when they found that it
led to the
river, and that nobody opposed them, they immediately climbed over
the rampart, and were followed by all our cavalry.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.69": [3.69] In the mean time Pompey, by
the great delay which this occasioned, being informed of what had happened,
marched with the
fifth legion, which he called away from their work to support his party;
and at the same time his cavalry were advancing up to ours, and an army
in order
of battle, was seen at a distance by our men who had taken possession
of the camp, and the face of affairs was suddenly changed. For Pompey's
legion,
encouraged by the hope of speedy support, attempted to make a stand
at the Decuman gate, and made a bold charge on our men. Caesar's cavalry,
who
had mounted the rampart by a narrow breach, being apprehensive of their
retreat, were the first to flee. The right wing which had been separated
from the
left, observing the terror of the cavalry, to prevent their being overpowered
within the lines, were endeavoring to retreat by the same way as they burst
in;
and most of them, lest they should be engaged in the narrow passes,
threw themselves down a rampart ten feet high into the trenches; and the
first being
trodden to death, the rest procured their safety, and escaped over
their bodies. The soldiers of the left wing, perceiving from the rampart
that Pompey was
advancing, and their own friends fleeing, being afraid that they should
be inclosed between the two ramparts, as they had an enemy both within
and
without, strove to secure their retreat the same way they came. All
was disorder, consternation, and flight; insomuch that, when Caesar laid
hold of the
colors of those who were running away, and desired them to stand, some
left their horses behind, and continued to run in the same manner; others
through
fear even threw away their colors. Nor did a single man face about.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.70": [3.70] In this calamity, the following
favorable circumstance occurred to prevent the ruin of our whole army,
viz., that Pompey
suspecting an ambuscade (because, as I suppose, the success had far
exceeded his hopes, as he had seen his men a moment before fleeing from
the
camp), durst not for some time approach the fortification; and that
his horse were retarded from pursuing, because the passes and gates were
in
possession of Caesar's soldiers. Thus a trifling circumstance proved
of great importance to each party; for the rampart drawn from the camp
to the river,
interrupted the progress and certainty of Caesar's victory, after he
had forged Pompey's camp. The same thing, by retarding the rapidity of
the enemy's
pursuit, preserved our army.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.71": [3.71] In the two actions of this
day, Caesar lost nine hundred and sixty rank and file, several Roman knights
of distinction, Felginas
Tuticanus Gallus, a senator's son; Caius Felginas from Placentia; Aulus
Gravius from Puteoli; Marcus Sacrativir from Capua; and thirty-two military
tribunes and centurions. But the greatest part of all these perished
without a wound, being trodden to death in the trenches, on the ramparts
and banks of
the river by reason of the terror and flight of their own men. Pompey,
after this battle, was saluted Imperator; this title he retained, and allowed
himself to
be addressed by it afterward. But neither in his letters to the senate,
nor in the fasces, did he use the laurel as a mark of honor. But Labienus,
having
obtained his consent that the prisoners should be delivered up to him,
had them all brought out, as it appeared, to make a show of them, and that
Pompey
might place a greater confidence in him who was a deserter; and calling
them fellow soldiers, and asking them in the most insulting manner whether
it was
usual with veterans to flee, ordered them to be put to death in the
sight of the whole army.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.72": [3.72] Pompey's party were so elated
with confidence and spirit at this success, that they thought no more of
the method of
conducting the war, but thought that they were already conquerors.
They did not consider that the smallness of our numbers, and the disadvantage
of the
place and the confined nature of the ground occasioned by their having
first possessed themselves of the camp, and the double danger both from
within
and without the fortifications, and the separation of the army into
two parts, so that the one could not give relief to the other, were the
causes of our
defeat. They did not consider, in addition, that the contest was not
decided by a vigorous attack, nor a regular battle; and that our men had
suffered
greater loss from their numbers and want of room, than they had sustained
from the enemy. In fine, they did not reflect on the common casualties
of war;
how trifling causes, either from groundless suspicions, sudden affright,
or religious scruples, have oftentimes been productive of considerable
losses; how
often an army has been unsuccessful either by the misconduct of the
general, or the oversight of a tribune; but as if they had proved victorious
by their
valor, and as if no change could ever take place, they published the
success of the day throughout the world by reports and letters.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.73": [3.73] Caesar, disappointed in his
first intentions, resolved to change the whole plan of his operations.
Accordingly, he at once called
in all outposts, gave over the siege, and collecting his army into
one place, addressed his soldiers and encouraged them "not to be troubled
at what had
happened, nor to be dismayed at it, but to weigh their many successful
engagements against one disappointment, and that, too, a trifling one.
That they
ought to be grateful to Fortune, through whose favor they had recovered
Italy without the effusion of blood; through whose favor they had subdued
the
two Spains, though protected by a most warlike people under the command
of the most skillful and experienced generals; through whose favor they
had
reduced to submission the neighboring states that abounded with corn;
in fine, that they ought to remember with what success they had been all
transported safe through blockading fleets of the enemy, which possessed
not only the ports, but even the coasts; that if all their attempts were
not
crowned with success, the defects of Fortune must be supplied by industry;
and whatever loss had been sustained, ought to be attributed rather to
her
caprices than to any faults in him: that he had chosen a safe ground
for the engagement, that he had possessed himself of the enemy's camp;
that he had
beaten them out, and overcome them when they offered resistance; but
whether their own terror or some mistake, or whether Fortune herself had
interrupted a victory almost secured and certain, they ought all now
to use their utmost efforts to repair by their valor the loss which had
been incurred; if
they did so, their misfortunes would turn to their advantage, as it
happened at Gergovia, and those who feared to face the enemy would be the
first to offer
themselves to battle.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.74": [3.74] Having concluded his speech,
he disgraced some standard-bearers, and reduced them to the ranks; for
the whole army was
seized with such grief at their loss and with such an ardent desire
of repairing their disgrace, that not a man required the command of his
tribune or
centurion, but they imposed each on himself severer labors than usual
as a punishment, and at the same time were so inflamed with eagerness to
meet the
enemy, that the officers of the first rank, sensibly affected at their
entreaties, were of opinion that they ought to continue in their present
posts, and commit
their fate to the hazard of a battle. But, on the other hand, Caesar
could not place sufficient confidence in men so lately thrown into consternation,
and
thought he ought to allow them time to recover their dejected spirits;
and having abandoned his works, he was apprehensive of being distressed
for want
of corn.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.75": [3.75] Accordingly, suffering no
time to intervene but what was necessary for a proper attention to be paid
to the sick and wounded,
he sent on all his baggage privately in the beginning of the night
from his camp to Apollonia, and ordered them not to halt till they had
performed their
journey; and he detached one legion with them as a convoy. This affair
being concluded, having retained only two legions in his camp, he marched
the rest
of his army out at three o'clock in the morning by several gates, and
sent them forward by the same route; and in a short space after, that the
military
practice might be preserved, and his march known as late as possible,
he ordered the signal for decamping to be given; and setting out immediately
and
following the rear of his own army, he was soon out of sight of the
camp. Nor did Pompey, as soon as he had notice of his design, make any
delay to
pursue him; but with a view to surprise them while encumbered with
baggage on their march, and not yet recovered from their fright, he led
his army out of
his camp, and sent his cavalry on to retard our rear; but was not able
to come up with them, because Caesar had got far before him, and marched
without
baggage. But when we reached the river Genusus, the banks being steep,
their horse overtook our rear, and detained them by bringing them to action.
To
oppose whom, Caesar sent his horse, and intermixed with them about
four hundred of his advanced light troops, who attacked their horse with
such
success, that having routed them all, and killed several, they returned
without any loss to the main body.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.76": [3.76] Having performed the exact
march which he had proposed that day, and having led his army over the
river Genusus, Caesar
posted himself in his old camp opposite Asparagium; and kept his soldiers
close within the intrenchments and ordered the horse, who had been sent
out
under pretense of foraging, to retire immediately into the camp, through
the Decuman gate. Pompey, in like manner, having completed the same day's
march, took post in his old camp at Asparagium; and his soldiers, as
they had no work (the fortifications being entire), made long excursions,
some to
collect wood and forage; others, invited by the nearness of the former
camp, laid up their arms in their tents, and quitted the intrenchments
in order to
bring what they had left behind them, because the design of marching
being adopted in a hurry, they had left a considerable part of their wagons
and
luggage behind. Being thus incapable of pursuing, as Caesar had foreseen,
about noon he gave the signal for marching, led out his army, and doubling
that
day's march, he advanced eight miles beyond Pompey's camp; who could
not pursue him, because his troops were dispersed.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.77": [3.77] The next day Caesar sent his
baggage forward early in the night, and marched off himself immediately
after the fourth watch:
that if he should be under the necessity of risking an engagement,
he might meet a sudden attack with an army free from incumbrance. He did
so for
several days successively, by which means he was enabled to effect
his march over the deepest rivers, and through the most intricate roads
without any
loss. For Pompey, after the first day's delay, and the fatigue which
he endured for some days in vain, though he exerted himself by forced marches,
and
was anxious to overtake us, who had got the start of him, on the fourth
day desisted from the pursuit, and determined to follow other measures.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.78": [3.78] Caesar was obliged to go to
Apollonia, to lodge his wounded, pay his army, confirm his friends, and
leave garrisons in the
towns. But for these matters, he allowed no more time than was necessary
for a person in haste. And being apprehensive for Domitius, lest he should
be
surprised by Pompey's arrival, he hastened with all speed and earnestness
to join him; for he planned the operations of the whole campaign on these
principles: that if Pompey should march after him, he would be drawn
off from the sea, and from those forces which he had provided in Dyrrachium,
and
separated from his corn and magazines, and be obliged to carry on the
war on equal terms; but if he crossed over into Italy, Caesar, having effected
a
junction with Domitius, would march through Illyricum to the relief
of Italy; but if he endeavored to storm Apollonia and Oricum, and exclude
him from the
whole coast, he hoped, by besieging Scipio, to oblige him, of necessity,
to come to his assistance. Accordingly, Caesar dispatching couriers, writes
to
Domitius, and acquaints him with his wishes on the subject: and having
stationed a garrison of four cohorts at Apollonia, one at Lissus, and three
at
Oricum, besides those who were sick of their wounds, he set forward
on his march through Epirus and Acarnania. Pompey, also, guessing at Caesar's
design, determined to hasten to Scipio, that if Caesar should march
in that direction, he might be ready to relieve him; but that if Caesar
should be unwilling
to quit the sea-coast and Corcyra, because he expected legions and
cavalry from Italy, he himself might fall on Domitius with all his forces.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.79": [3.79] For these reasons, each of
them studied dispatch, that he might succor his friends, and not miss an
opportunity of surprising his
enemies. But Caesar's engagements at Apollonia had carried him aside
from the direct road. Pompey had taken the short road to Macedonia, through
Candavia. To this was added another unexpected disadvantage, that Domitius,
who for several days had been encamped opposite Scipio, had quitted that
post for the sake of provisions, and had marched to Heraclea Sentica,
a city subject to Candavia; so that fortune herself seemed to throw him
in Pompey's
way. Of this, Caesar was ignorant up to this time. Letters likewise
being sent by Pompey through all the provinces and states, with an account
of the
action at Dyrrachium, very much enlarged and exaggerated beyond the
real facts, a rumor had been circulated, that Caesar had been defeated
and forced
to flee, and had lost almost all his forces. These reports had made
the roads dangerous, and drawn off some states from his alliance: whence
it happened,
that the messengers dispatched by Caesar, by several different roads
to Domitius, and by Domitius to Caesar, were not able by any means to accomplish
their journey. But the Allobroges, who were in the retinue of Aegus
and Roscillus, and who had deserted to Pompey, having met on the road a
scouting
party of Domitius; either from old acquaintance, because they had served
together in Gaul, or elated with vain glory, gave them an account of all
that had
happened, and informed them of Caesar's departure, and Pompey's arrival.
Domitius, who was scarce four hours' march distant, having got intelligence
from these, by the courtesy of the enemy, avoided the danger, and met
Caesar coming to join him at Aeginium, a town on the confines of and opposite
to
Thessaly.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.80": [3.80] The two armies being united,
Caesar marched to Gomphi, which is the first town of Thessaly on the road
from Epirus. Now,
the Thessalians, a few months before, had of themselves sent embassadors
to Caesar, offering him the free use of every thing in their power, and
requesting a garrison for their protection. But the report, already
spoken of, of the battle at Dyrrachium, which it had exaggerated in many
particulars, had
arrived before him. In consequence of which, Androsthenes, the praetor
of Thessaly, as he preferred to be the companion of Pompey's victory, rather
than Caesar's associate in his misfortunes, collected all the people,
both slaves and freemen from the country into the town and shut the gates,
and
dispatched messengers to Scipio and Pompey "to come to his relief,
that he could depend on the strength of the town, if succor was speedily
sent; but that
it could not withstand a long siege." Scipio, as soon as he received
advice of the departure of the armies from Dyrrachium, had marched with
his legions to
Larissa: Pompey was not yet arrived near Thessaly. Caesar having fortified
his camp, ordered scaling-ladders and pent-houses to be made for a sudden
assault, and hurdles to be provided. As soon as they were ready, he
exhorted his soldiers, and told them of what advantage it would be to assist
them with
all sorts of necessaries, if they made themselves masters of a rich
and plentiful town: and, at the same time to strike terror into other states
by the example
of this, and to effect this with speed, before auxiliaries could arrive.
Accordingly, taking advantage of the unusual ardor of the soldiers, he
began his assault
on the town at a little after three o'clock on the very day on which
he arrived, and took it, though defended with very high walls, before sunset,
and gave it
up to his army to plunder, and immediately decamped from before it,
and marched to Metropolis, with such rapidity as to outstrip any messenger
or rumor
of the taking of Gomphi.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.81": [3.81] The inhabitants of Metropolis,
at first influenced by the same rumors, followed the same measures, shut
the gates and manned
their walls. But when they were made acquainted with the fate of the
city of Gomphi by some prisoners, whom Caesar had ordered to be brought
up to
the walls, they threw open their gates. As he preserved them with the
greatest care, there was not a state in Thessaly (except Larissa, which
was awed by
a strong army of Scipio's), but on comparing the fate of the inhabitants
of Metropolis with the severe treatment of Gomphi, gave admission to Caesar,
and
obeyed his orders. Having chosen a position convenient for procuring
corn, which was now almost ripe on the ground, he determined there to wait
Pompey's arrival, and to make it the center of all his warlike operations.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.82": [3.82] Pompey arrived in Thessaly
a few days after, and having harangued the combined army, returned thanks
to his own men, and
exhorted Scipio's soldiers, that as the victory was now secured, they
should endeavor to merit a part of the rewards and booty. And receiving
all the
legions into one camp, he shared his honors with Scipio, ordered the
trumpet to be sounded at his tent, and a pavilion to be erected for him.
The forces of
Pompey being thus augmented, and two such powerful armies united, their
former expectations were confirmed, and their hopes of victory so much
increased, that whatever time intervened was considered as so much
delay to their return into Italy; and whenever Pompey acted with slowness
and
caution, they used to exclaim, that it was the business only of a single
day, but that he had a passion for power, and was delighted in having persons
of
consular and praetorian rank in the number of his slaves. And they
now began to dispute openly about rewards and priesthoods, and disposed
of the
consulate for several years to come. Others put in their claims for
the houses and properties of all who were in Caesar's camp, and in that
council there
was a warm debate, whether Lucius Hirtius, who had been sent by Pompey
against the Parthians, should be admitted a candidate for the praetorship
in his
absence at the next election; his friends imploring Pompey's honor
to fulfill the engagements which he had made to him at his departure, that
he might not
seem deceived through his authority: while others, embarked in equal
labor and danger, pleaded that no individual ought to have a preference
before all
the rest.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.83": [3.83] Already Domitius, Scipio,
and Lentulus Spinther, in their daily quarrels about Caesar's priesthood,
openly abused each other in
the most scurrilous language. Lentulus urging the respect due to his
age, Domitius boasting his interest in the city and his dignity, and Scipio
presuming on
his alliance with Pompey. Attius Rufus charged Lucius Afranius before
Pompey with betraying the army in the action that happened in Spain, and
Lucius
Domitius declared in the council that it was his wish that, when the
war should be ended, three billets should be given to all the senators,
who had taken
part with them in the war, and that they should pass sentence on every
single person who had staid behind at Rome, or who had been within Pompey's
garrisons and had not contributed their assistance in the military
operations; that by the first billet they should have power to acquit,
by the second to pass
sentence of death, and by the third to impose a pecuniary fine. In
short, Pompey's whole army talked of nothing but the honors or sums of
money which
were to be their rewards, or of vengeance on their enemies; and never
considered how they were to defeat their enemies, but in what manner they
should
use their victory.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.84": [3.84] Corn being provided, and his
soldiers refreshed, and a sufficient time having elapsed since the engagement
at Dyrrachium, when
Caesar thought he had sufficiently sounded the disposition of his troops,
he thought that he ought to try whether Pompey had any intention or inclination
to
come to a battle. Accordingly he led his troops out of the camp, and
ranged them in order of battle, at first on their own ground, and at a
small distance
from Pompey's camp: but afterward for several days in succession, he
advanced from his own camp, and led them up to the hills on which Pompey's
troops were posted, which conduct inspired his army every day with
fresh courage. However he adhered to his former purpose respecting his
cavalry, for
as he was by many degrees inferior in number, he selected the youngest
and most active of the advanced guard, and desired them to fight intermixed
with
the horse, and they by constant practice acquired experience in this
kind of battle. By these means it was brought to pass that a thousand of
his horse
would dare even on open ground, to stand against seven thousand of
Pompey's, if occasion required, and would not be much terrified by their
number.
For even on one of those days he was successful in a cavalry action,
and killed one of the two Allobrogians, who had deserted to Pompey, as
we before
observed, and several others.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.85": [3.85] Pompey, because he was encamped
on a hill, drew up his army at the very foot of it, ever in expectation,
as may be
conjectured, that Caesar would expose himself to this disadvantageous
situation. Caesar, seeing no likelihood of being able to bring Pompey to
an action,
judged it the most expedient method of conducting the war, to decamp
from that post and to be always in motion: with this hope, that by shifting
his camp
and removing from place to place, he might be more conveniently supplied
with corn, and also, that by being in motion he might get some opportunity
of
forcing them to battle, and might by constant marches harass Pompey's
army, which was not accustomed to fatigue. These matters being settled,
when the
signal for marching was given, and the tents struck, it was observed
that shortly before, contrary to his daily practice, Pompey's army had
advanced
further than usual from his intrenchments, so that it appeared possible
to come to an action on equal ground. Then Caesar addressed himself to
his
soldiers, when they were at the gates of the camp, ready to march out.
" We must defer," says he, "our march at present, and set our thoughts
on battle,
which has been our constant wish; let us then meet the foe with resolute
souls. We shall not hereafter easily find such an opportunity." He immediately
marched out at the head of his troops.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.86": [3.86] Pompey also, as was afterward
known, at the unanimous solicitation of his friends, had determined to
try the fate of a battle.
For he had even declared in council a few days before that, before
the battalions came to battle, Caesar's army would be put to the rout.
When most
people expressed their surprise at it, "I know," says he, "that I promise
a thing almost incredible; but hear the plan on which I proceed, that you
may
march to battle with more confidence and resolution. I have persuaded
our cavalry, and they have engaged to execute it, as soon as the two armies
have
met, to attack Caesar's right wing on the flank, and inclosing their
army on the rear, throw them into disorder, and put them to the rout, before
we shall
throw a weapon against the enemy. By this means we shall put an end
to the war, without endangering the legions, and almost without a blow.
Nor is this
a difficult matter, as we far outnumber them in cavalry." At the same
time he gave them notice to be ready for battle on the day following, and
since the
opportunity which they had so often wished for was now arrived, not
to disappoint the opinion generally entertained of their experience and
valor.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.87": [3.87] After him Labienus spoke,
as well to express his contempt of Caesar's forces, as to extol Pompey's
scheme with the highest
encomiums. "Think not, Pompey," says he, "that this is the army which
conquered Gaul and Germany; I was present at all those battles, and do
not speak
at random on a subject to which I am a stranger: a very small part
of that army now remains, great numbers lost their lives, as must necessarily
happen in
so many battles, many fell victims to the autumnal pestilence in Italy,
many returned home, and many were left behind on the continent. Have you
not heard
that the cohorts at Brundusium are composed of invalids? The forces
which you now behold, have been recruited by levies lately made in Hither
Spain,
and the greater part from the colonies beyond the Po; moreover, the
flower of the forces perished in the two engagements at Dyrrachium." Having
so said,
he took an oath, never to return to his camp unless victorious; and
he encouraged the rest to do the like. Pompey applauded his proposal, and
took the
same oath; nor did any person present hesitate to take it. After this
had passed in the council they broke up full of hopes and joy, and in imagination
anticipated victory; because they thought that in a matter of such
importance, no groundless assertion could be made by a general of such
experience.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.88": [3.88] When Caesar had approached
near Pompey's camp, he observed that his army was drawn up in the following
manner: On the
left wing were the two legions, delivered over by Caesar at the beginning
of the disputes in compliance with the senate's decree, one of which was
called
the first, the other the third. Here Pompey commanded in person. Scipio
with the Syrian legions commanded the center. The Cilician legion in conjunction
with the Spanish cohorts, which we said were brought over by Afranius,
were disposed on the right wing. These Pompey considered his steadiest
troops.
The rest he had interspersed between the center and the wing, and he
had a hundred and ten complete cohorts; these amounted to forty-five thousand
men. He had besides two cohorts of volunteers, who having received
favors from him in former wars, flocked to his standard: these were dispersed
through his whole army. The seven remaining cohorts he had disposed
to protect his camp, and the neighboring forts. His right wing was secured
by a
river with steep banks; for which reason he placed all his cavalry,
archers, and slingers, on his left wing.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.89": [3.89] Caesar, observing his former
custom, had placed the tenth legion on the right, the ninth on the left,
although it was very much
weakened by the battles at Dyrrachium. He placed the eighth legion
so close to the ninth, as to almost make one of the two, and ordered them
to support
one another. He drew up on the field eighty cohorts, making a total
of twenty-two thousand men. He left two cohorts to guard the camp. He gave
the
command of the left wing to Antonius, of the right to P. Sulla, and
of the center to Cn. Domitius: he himself took his post opposite Pompey.
At the same
time, fearing, from the disposition of the enemy which we have previously
mentioned, lest his right wing might be surrounded by their numerous cavalry,
he
rapidly drafted a single cohort from each of the legions composing
the third line, formed of them a fourth line, and opposed them to Pompey's
cavalry,
and, acquainting them with his wishes, admonished them that the success
of that day depended on their courage. At the same time he ordered the
third
line, and the entire army not to charge without his command: that he
would give the signal whenever he wished them to do so.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.90": [3.90] When he was exhorting his
army to battle, according to the military custom, and spoke to them of
the favors that they had
constantly received from him, he took especial care to remind them
"that he could call his soldiers to witness the earnestness with which
he had sought
peace, the efforts that he had made by Vatinius to gain a conference
[with Labienus], and likewise by Claudius to treat with Scipio, in what
manner he had
exerted himself at Oricum, to gain permission from Libo to send embassadors;
that he had been always reluctant to shed the blood of his soldiers, and
did
not wish to deprive the republic of one or other of her armies." After
delivering this speech, he gave by a trumpet the signal to his soldiers,
who were
eagerly demanding it, and were very impatient for the onset.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.91": [3.91] There was in Caesar's army,
a volunteer of the name of Crastinus, who the year before had been first
centurion of the tenth
legion, a man of pre-eminent bravery. He, when the signal was given,
says, "Follow me, my old comrades, and display such exertions in behalf
of your
general as you have determined to do: this is our last battle, and
when it shall be won, he will recover his dignity, and we our liberty."
At the same time he
looked back to Caesar, and said, "General, I will act in such a manner
to-day, that you will feel grateful to me living or dead." After uttering
these words
he charged first on the right wing, and about one hundred and twenty
chosen volunteers of the same century followed.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.92": [3.92] There was so much space left
between the two lines, as sufficed for the onset of the hostile armies:
but Pompey had ordered his
soldiers to await Caesar's attack, and not to advance from their position,
or suffer their line to be put into disorder. And he is said to have done
this by the
advice of Caius Triarius, that the impetuosity of the charge of Caesar's
soldiers might be checked, and their line broken, and that Pompey's troops
remaining in their ranks, might attack them while in disorder; and
he thought that the javelins would fall with less force if the soldiers
were kept in their
ground, than if they met them in their course; at the same time he
trusted that Caesar's soldiers, after running over double the usual ground,
would become
weary and exhausted by the fatigue. But to me Pompey seems to have
acted without sufficient reason: for there is a certain impetuosity of
spirit and an
alacrity implanted by nature in the hearts of all men, which is inflamed
by a desire to meet the foe. This a general should endeavor not to repress,
but to
increase; nor was it a vain institution of our ancestors, that the
trumpets should sound on all sides, and a general shout be raised; by which
they imagined
that the enemy were struck with terror, and their own army inspired
with courage.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.93": [3.93] But our men, when the signal
was given, rushed forward with their javelins ready to be launched, but
perceiving that Pompey's
men did not run to meet their charge, having acquired experience by
custom, and being practiced in former battles, they of their own accord
repressed
their speed, and halted almost midway; that they might not come up
with the enemy when their strength was exhausted, and after a short respite
they again
renewed their course, and threw their javelins, and instantly drew
their swords, as Caesar had ordered them. Nor did Pompey's men fail in
this crisis, for
they received our javelins, stood our charge, and maintained their
ranks; and having launched their javelins, had recourse to their swords.
At the same time
Pompey's horse, according to their orders, rushed out at once from
his left wing, and his whole host of archers poured after them. Our cavalry
did not
withstand their charge: but gave ground a little, upon which Pompey's
horse pressed them more vigorously, and began to file off in troops, and
flank
our
army. When Caesar perceived this, he gave the signal to his fourth
line, which he had formed of the six cohorts. They instantly rushed forward
and
charged Pompey's horse with such fury, that not a man of them stood;
but all wheeling about, not only quitted their post, but galloped forward
to seek a
refuge in the highest mountains. By their retreat the archers and slingers,
being left destitute and defenseless, were all cut to pieces. The cohorts,
pursuing
their success, wheeled about upon Pompey's left wing, while his infantry
still continued to make battle, and attacked them in the rear.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.94": [3.94] At the same time Caesar ordered
his third line to advance, which till then had not been engaged, but had
kept their post. Thus,
new and fresh troops having come to the assistance of the fatigued,
and others having made an attack on their rear, Pompey's men were not able
to
maintain their ground, but all fled, nor was Caesar deceived in his
opinion, that the victory, as he had declared in his speech to his soldiers,
must have its
beginning from those six cohorts, which he had placed as a fourth line
to oppose the horse. For by them the cavalry were routed; by them the archers
and
slingers were cut to pieces; by them the left wing of Pompey's army
was surrounded, and obliged to be the first to flee. But when Pompey saw
his cavalry
routed, and that part of his army on which he reposed his greatest
hopes thrown into confusion, despairing of the rest, he quitted the field,
and retreated
straightway on horseback to his camp, and calling to the centurions,
whom he had placed to guard the praetorian gate, with a loud voice, that
the soldiers
might hear: "Secure the camp," says he, "defend it with diligence,
if any danger should threaten it; I will visit the other gates, and encourage
the guards of
the camp." Having thus said, he retired into his tent in utter despair,
yet anxiously waiting the issue.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.95": [3.95] Caesar having forced the Pompeians
to flee into their intrenchment, and thinking that he ought not to allow
them any respite to
recover from their fright, exhorted his soldiers to take advantage
of fortune's kindness, and to attack the camp. Though they were fatigued
by the intense
heat, for the battle had continued till mid-day, yet, being prepared
to undergo any labor, they cheerfully obeyed his command. The camp was
bravely
defended by the cohorts which had been left to guard it, but with much
more spirit by the Thracians and foreign auxiliaries. For the soldiers
who had fled
for refuge to it from the field of battle, affrighted and exhausted
by fatigue, having thrown away their arms and military standards, had their
thoughts more
engaged on their further escape than on the defense of the camp. Nor
could the troops who were posted on the battlements, long withstand the
immense
number of our darts, but fainting under their wounds, quitted the place,
and under the conduct of their centurions and tribunes, fled, without stopping,
to
the high mountains which joined the camp.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.96": [3.96] In Pompey's camp you might
see arbors in which tables were laid, a large quantity of plate set out,
the floors of the tents
covered with fresh sods, the tents of Lucius Lentulus and others shaded
with ivy, and many other things which were proofs of excessive luxury,
and a
confidence of victory, so that it might readily be inferred that they
had no apprehensions of the issue of the day, as they indulged themselves
in unnecessary
pleasures, and yet upbraided with luxury Caesar's army, distressed
and suffering troops, who had always been in want of common necessaries.
Pompey,
as soon as our men had forced the trenches, mounting his horse, and
stripping off his general's habit, went hastily out of the back gate of
the camp, and
galloped with all speed to Larissa. Nor did he stop there, but with
the same dispatch, collecting a few of his flying troops, and halting neither
day nor night,
he arrived at the seaside, attended by only thirty horse, and went
on board a victualing barque, often complaining, as we have been told,
that he had been
so deceived in his expectation, that he was almost persuaded that he
had been betrayed by those from whom he had expected victory, as they began
the
fight.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.97": [3.97] Caesar having possessed himself
of Pompey's camp, urged his soldiers not to be too intent on plunder, and
lose the opportunity
of completing their conquest. Having obtained their consent, he began
to draw lines round the mountain. The Pompeians distrusting the position,
as there
was no water on the mountain, abandoned it, and all began to retreat
toward Larissa; which Caesar perceiving, divided his troops, and ordering
part of his
legions to remain in Pompey's camp, sent back a part to his own camp,
and taking four legions with him, went by a shorter road to intercept the
enemy:
and having marched six miles, drew up his army. But the Pompeians observing
this, took post on a mountain, whose foot was washed by a river. Caesar
having encouraged his troops, though they were greatly exhausted by
incessant labor the whole day, and night was now approaching, by throwing
up
works cut off the communication between the river and the mountain,
that the enemy might not get water in the night. As soon as the work was
finished,
they sent embassadors to treat about a capitulation. A few senators
who had espoused that party, made their escape by night.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.98": [3.98] At break of day, Caesar ordered
all those who had taken post on the mountain, to come down from the higher
grounds into the
plain, and pile their arms. When they did this without refusal, and
with outstretched arms, prostrating themselves on the ground, with tears,
implored his
mercy: he comforted them and bade them rise, and having spoken a few
words of his own clemency to alleviate their fears, he pardoned them all,
and
gave orders to his soldiers, that no injury should be done to them,
and nothing taken from them. Having used this diligence, he ordered the
legions in his
camp to come and meet him, and those which were with him to take their
turn of rest, and go back to the camp: and the same day went to Larissa
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.99": [3.99] In that battle, no more than
two hundred privates were missing, but Caesar lost about thirty centurions,
valiant officers.
Crastinus, also, of whom mention was made before, fighting most courageously,
lost his life by the wound of a sword in the mouth; nor was that false
which he declared when marching to battle: for Caesar entertained the
highest opinion of his behavior in that battle, and thought him highly
deserving of his
approbation. Of Pompey's army, there fell about fifteen thousand; but
upwards of twenty-four thousand were made prisoners: for even the cohorts
which
were stationed in the forts, surrendered to Sylla. Several others took
shelter in the neighboring states. One hundred and eighty stands of colors,
and nine
eagles, were brought to Caesar. Lucius Domitius, fleeing from the camp
to the mountains, his strength being exhausted by fatigue, was killed by
the horse.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.100": [3.100] About this time, Decimus
Laelius arrived with his fleet at Brundusium and in the same manner, as
Libo had done before,
possessed himself of an island opposite the harbor of Brundusium. In
like manner, Valinius, who was then governor of Brundusium, with a few
decked
barks, endeavored to entice Laelius's fleet, and took one five-banked
galley and two smaller vessels that had ventured further than the rest
into a narrow
part of the harbor: and likewise disposing the horse along the shore,
strove to prevent the enemy from procuring fresh water. But Laelius having
chosen a
more convenient season of the year for his expedition, supplied himself
with water brought in transports from Corcyra and Dyrrachium, and was not
deterred from his purpose; and till he had received advice of the battle
in Thessaly, he could not be forced either by the disgrace of losing his
ships, or by
the want of necessaries, to quit the port and islands.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.101": [3.101] Much about the same time,
Cassius arrived in Sicily with a fleet of Syrians, Phoenicians, and Cicilians:
and as Caesar's fleet
was divided into two parts, Publius Sulpicius the praetor commanding
one division at Vibo near the straits, Pomponius the other at Messana,
Cassius got
into Messana with his fleet, before Pomponius had notice of his arrival,
and having found him in disorder, without guards or discipline, and the
wind being
high and favorable, he filled several transports with fir, pitch, and
tow, and other combustibles, and sent them against Pomponius's fleet, and
set fire to all
his ships, thirty-five in number, twenty of which were armed with beaks:
and this action struck such terror that though there was a legion in garrison
at
Messana, the town with difficulty held out, and had not the news of
Caesar's victory been brought at that instant by the horse stationed-along
the coast, it
was generally imagined that it would have been lost, but the town was
maintained till the news arrived very opportunely: and Cassius set sail
from thence
to attack Sulpicius's fleet at Vibo, and our ships being moored to
the land, to strike the same terror, he acted in the same manner as before.
The wind
being favorable, he sent into the port about forty ships provided with
combustibles, and the flame catching on both sides, five ships were burned
to ashes.
And when the fire began to spread wider by the violence of the wind,
the soldiers of the veteran legions, who had been left to guard the fleet,
being
considered as invalids, could not endure the disgrace, but of themselves
went on board the ships and weighed anchor, and having attacked Cassius's
fleet,
captured two five-banked galleys, in one of which was Cassius himself;
but he made his escape by taking to a boat. Two three-banked galleys were
taken
besides. Intelligence was shortly after received of the action in Thessaly,
so well authenticated, that the Pompeians themselves gave credit to it;
for they
had hitherto believed it a fiction of Caesar's lieutenants and friends.
Upon which intelligence Cassius departed with his fleet from that coast.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.102": [3.102] Caesar thought he ought
to postpone all business and pursue Pompey, whithersoever he should retreat;
that he might not be
able to provide fresh forces, and renew the war; he therefore marched
on every day, as far as his cavalry were able to advance, and ordered one
legion to
follow him by shorter journeys. A proclamation was issued by Pompey
at Amphipolis, that all the young men of that province, Grecians and Roman
citizens, should take the military oath; but whether he issued it with
an intention of preventing suspicion, and to conceal as long as possible
his design of
fleeing further, or to endeavor to keep possession of Macedonia by
new levies, if nobody pursued him, it is impossible to judge. He lay at
anchor one
night, and calling together his friends in Amphipolis, and collecting
a sum of money for his necessary expenses, upon advice of Caesar's approach,
set sail
from that place, and arrived in a few days at Mitylene. Here he was
detained two days, and having added a few galleys to his fleet he went
to Cilicia, and
thence to Cyprus. There he is informed that, by the consent of all
the inhabitants of Antioch and Roman citizens who traded there, the castle
had been
seized to shut him out of the town; and that messengers had been dispatched
to all those who were reported to have taken refuge in the neighboring
states,
that they should not come to Antioch; that if they did, that it would
be attended with imminent danger to their lives. The same thing had happened
to Lucius
Lentulus, who had been consul the year before, and to Publius Lentulus
a consular senator, and to several others at Rhodes, who having followed
Pompey
in his flight, and arrived at the island, were not admitted into the
town or port; and having received a message to leave that neighborhood,
set sail much
against their will; for the rumor of Caesar's approach had now reached
those states.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.103": [3.103] Pompey, being informed of
these proceedings, laid aside his design of going to Syria, and having
taken the public money
from the farmers of the revenue, and borrowed more from some private
friends, and having put on board his ships a large quantity of brass for
military
purposes, and two thousand armed men, whom he partly selected from
the slaves of the tax farmers, and partly collected from the merchants,
and such
persons as each of his friends thought fit on this occasion, he sailed
for Pelusium. It happened that king Ptolemy, a minor, was there with a
considerable
army, engaged in war with his sister Cleopatra, whom a few months before,
by the assistance of his relations and friends, he had expelled from the
kingdom; and her camp lay at a small distance from his. To him Pompey
applied to be permitted to take refuge in Alexandria, and to be protected
in his
calamity by his powerful assistance, in consideration of the friendship
and amity which had subsisted between his father and him. But Pompey's
deputies
having executed their commission, began to converse with less restraint
with the king's troops, and to advise them to act with friendship to Pompey,
and
not to think meanly of his bad fortune. In Ptolemy's army were several
of Pompey's soldiers, of whom Gabinius had received the command in Syria,
and
had brought them over to Alexandria, and at the conclusion of the war
had left with Ptolemy the father of the young king.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.104": [3.104] The king's friends, who
were regents of the kingdom during the minority, being informed of these
things, either induced by
fear, as they afterward declared, lest Pompey should corrupt the king's
army, and seize on Alexandria and Egypt; or despising his bad fortune,
as in
adversity friends commonly change to enemies, in public gave a favorable
answer to his deputies, and desired him to come to the king; but secretly
laid a
plot against him, and dispatched Achillas, captain of the king's guards,
a man of singular boldness, and Lucius Septimius a military tribune to
assassinate
him. Being kindly addressed by them, and deluded by an acquaintance
with Septimius, because in the war with the pirates the latter had commanded
a
company under him, he embarked in a small boat with a few attendants,
and was there murdered by Achillas and Septimius. In like manner, Lucius
Lentulus was seized by the king's order, and put to death in prison.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.105": [3.105] When Caesar arrived in Asia,
he found that Titus Ampius had attempted to remove the money from the temple
of Diana at
Ephesus; and for this purpose had convened all the senators in the
province that he might have them to attest the sum, but was interrupted
by Caesar's
arrival, and had made his escape. Thus, on two occasions, Caesar saved
the money of Ephesus. It was also remarked at Elis, in the temple of Minerva,
upon calculating and enumerating the days, that on the very day on
which Caesar had gained his battle, the image of Victory which was placed
before
Minerva, and faced her statue, turned about toward the portal and entrance
of the temple; and the same day, at Antioch in Syria, such a shout of an
army
and sound of trumpets was twice heard that the citizens ran in arms
to the walls. The same thing happened at Ptolemais; a sound of drums too
was heard
at Pergamus, in the private and retired parts of the temple, into which
none but the priests are allowed admission, and which the Greeks call Adyta
(the
inaccessible), and likewise at Tralles, in the temple of Victory, in
which there stood a statue consecrated to Caesar; a palm-tree at that time
was shown
that had sprouted up from the pavement, through the joints of the stones,
and shot up above the roof.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.106": [3.106] After a few days' delay
in Asia, Caesar, having heard that Pompey had been seen in Cyprus, and
conjecturing that he had
directed his course into Egypt, on account of his connection with that
kingdom, set out for Alexandria with two legions (one of which he ordered
to follow
him from Thessaly, the other he called in from Achaia, from Fufius,
the lieutenant general), and with eight hundred horse, ten ships of war
from Rhodes,
and a few from Asia. These legions amounted but to three thousand two
hundred men; the rest, disabled by wounds received in various battles,
by fatigue
and the length of their march, could not follow him. But Caesar, relying
on the fame of his exploits, did not hesitate to set forward with a feeble
force, and
thought that he would be secure in any place. At Alexandria he was
informed of the death of Pompey: and at his landing there, heard a cry
among the
soldiers whom the king had left to garrison the town, and saw a crowd
gathering toward him, because the fasces were carried before him; for this
the
whole multitude thought an infringement of the king's dignity. Though
this tumult was appeased, frequent disturbances were raised for several
days
successively, by crowds of the populace, and a great many of his soldiers
were killed in all parts of the city.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.107": [3.107] Having observed this, he
ordered other legions to be brought to him from Asia, which he had made
up out of Pompey's
soldiers; for he was himself detained against his will, by the etesian
winds, which are totally unfavorable to persons on a voyage from Alexandria.
In the
mean time, considering that the disputes of the princes belonged to
the jurisdiction of the Roman people, and of him as consul, and that it
was a duty more
incumbent on him, as in his former consulate a league had been made
with Ptolemy the late king, under sanction both of a law and a decree of
the senate,
he signified that it was his pleasure that king Ptolemy, and his sister
Cleopatra, should disband their armies, and decide their disputes in his
presence by
justice, rather than by the sword.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.108": [3.108] A eunuch named Pothinus,
the boy's tutor, was regent of the kingdom on account of his youthfulness.
He at first began to
complain among his friends, and to express his indignation, that the
king should be summoned to plead his cause: but afterward, having prevailed
on some
of those whom he had made acquainted with his views to join him he
secretly called the army away from Pelusium to Alexandria, and appointed
Achillas,
already spoken of, commander-in-chief of the forces. Him he encouraged
and animated by promises both in his own and the king's name, and instructed
him both by letters and messages how he should act. By the will of
Ptolemy the father, the elder of his two sons and the more advanced in
years of his two
daughters were declared his heirs, and for the more effectual performance
of his intention, in the same will he conjured the Roman people by all
the gods,
and by the league which he had entered into at Rome, to see his will
executed. One of the copies of his will was conveyed to Rome by his embassadors
to
be deposited in the treasury, but the public troubles preventing it,
it was lodged with Pompey: another was left sealed up, and kept at Alexandria.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.109": [3.109] While these things were
debated before Caesar, and he was very anxious to settle the royal disputes
as a common friend and
arbitrator; news was brought on a sudden that the king's army and all
his cavalry, were on their march to Alexandria. Caesar's forces were by
no means
so strong that he could trust to them, if he had occasion to hazard
a battle without the town. His only resource was to keep within the town
in the most
convenient places, and get information of Achillas's designs. However
he ordered his soldiers to repair to their arms; and advised the king to
send some of
his friends, who had the greatest influence, as deputies to Achillas,
and to signify his royal pleasure. Dioscorides and Serapion, the persons
sent by him,
who had both been embassadors at Rome, and had been in great esteem
with Ptolemy the father, went to Achillas. But as soon as they appeared
in his
presence, without hearing them, or learning the occasion of their coming,
he ordered them to be seized and put to death. One of them, after receiving
a
wound, was taken up and carried off by his attendants as dead: the
other was killed on the spot. Upon this, Caesar took care to secure the
king's person,
both supposing that the king's name would have a great influence with
his subjects, and to give the war the appearance of the scheme of a few
desperate
men, rather than of having been begun by the king's consent.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.110": [3.110] The forces under Achillas
did not seem despicable, either for number, spirit, or military experience;
for he had twenty
thousand men under arms. They consisted partly of Gabinius's soldiers,
who were now become habituated to the licentious mode of living at Alexandria,
and had forgotten the name and discipline of the Roman people, and
had married wives there, by whom the greatest part of them had children.
To these
was added a collection of highwaymen, and freebooters, from Syria,
and the province of Cilicia, and the adjacent countries. Besides several
convicts and
transports had been collected: for at Alexandria all our runaway slaves
were sure of finding protection for their persons on the condition that
they should
give in their names, and enlist as soldiers: and if any of them was
apprehended by his master, he was rescued by a crowd of his fellow soldiers,
who being
involved in the same guilt, repelled, at the hazard of their lives,
every violence offered to any of their body. These by a prescriptive privilege
of the
Alexandrian army, used to demand the king's favorites to be put to
death, pillage the properties of the rich to increase their pay, invest
the king's palace,
banish some from the kingdom, and recall others from exile. Besides
these, there were two thousand horse, who had acquired the skill of veterans
by
being in several wars in Alexandria. These had restored Ptolemy the
father to his kingdom, had killed Bibulus's two sons; and had been engaged
in war
with the Egyptians; such was their experience in military affairs.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.111": [3.111] Full of confidence in his
troops, and despising the small number of Caesar's soldiers, Achillas seized
Alexandria, except that
part of the town which Caesar occupied with his troops. At first he
attempted to force the palace; but Caesar had disposed his cohorts through
the
streets, and repelled his attack. At the same time there was an action
at the port: where the contest was maintained with the greatest obstinacy.
For the
forces were divided, and the fight maintained in several streets at
once, and the enemy endeavored to seize with a strong party the ships of
war; of which
fifty had been sent to Pompey's assistance, but after the battle in
Thessaly, had returned home. They were all of either three or five banks
of oars, well
equipped and appointed with every necessary for a voyage. Besides these,
there were twenty-two vessels with decks, which were usually kept at
Alexandria, to guard the port. If they made themselves masters of these,
Caesar being deprived of his fleet, they would have the command of the
port and
whole sea, and could prevent him from procuring provisions and auxiliaries.
Accordingly that spirit was displayed, which ought to be displayed when
the
one party saw that a speedy victory depended on the issue, and the
other their safety. But Caesar gained the day, and set fire to all those
ships, and to
others which were in the docks, because he could not guard so many
places with so small a force; and immediately he conveyed some troops to
the
Pharos by his ships.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.3.112": [3.112] The Pharos is a tower on
an island, of prodigious height, built with amazing works, and takes its
name from the island. This
island lying over against Alexandria, forms a harbor; but on the upper
side it is connected with the town by a narrow way eight hundred paces
in length,
made by piles sunk in the sea, and by a bridge. In this island some
of the Egyptians have houses, and a village as large as a town; and whatever
ships from
any quarter, either through mistaking the channel, or by the storm,
have been driven from their course upon the coast, they constantly plunder
like pirates.
And without the consent of those who are masters of the Pharos, no
vessels can enter the harbor, on account of its narrowness. Caesar being
greatly
alarmed on this account, while the enemy were engaged in battle, landed
his soldiers, seized the Pharos, and placed a garrison in it. By this means
he
gained this point, that he could be supplied without danger with corn,
and auxiliaries; for he sent to all the neighboring countries, to demand
supplies. In
other parts of the town, they fought so obstinately, that they quitted
the field with equal advantage, and neither were beaten (in consequence
of the
narrowness of the passes); and a few being killed on both sides, Caesar
secured the most necessary posts, and fortified them in the night. In this
quarter of
the town was a wing of the king's palace, in which Caesar was lodged
on his first arrival, and a theater adjoining the house which served as
for citadel, and
commanded an avenue to the ports and other docks. These fortifications
he increased during the succeeding days, that he might have them before
him as a
rampart, and not be obliged to fight against his will. In the mean
time Ptolemy's younger daughter, hoping the throne would become vacant,
made her
escape from the palace to Achillas, and assisted him in prosecuting
the war. But they soon quarreled about the command, which circumstance
enlarged
the presents to the soldiers, for each endeavored by great sacrifices
to secure their affection. While the enemy was thus employed, Pothinus,
tutor to the
young king, and regent of the kingdom, who was in Caesar's part of
the town, sent messengers to Achillas, and encouraged him not to desist
from his
enterprise, nor to despair of success; but his messengers being discovered
and apprehended, he was put to death by Caesar. Such was the
commencement of the Alexandrian war.
