<p align="justify"> 51-50 B.C.
<p align="justify"> Preface to book 8
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.0": [8.0] Prevailed on by your continued
solicitations, Balbus, I have engaged in a most difficult task, as my daily
refusals appear to plead
not my inability, but indolence, as an excuse. I have compiled a continuation
of the Commentaries of our Caesar's Wars in Gaul, not indeed to be
compared to his writings, which either precede or follow them; and
recently, I have completed what he left imperfect after the transactions
in Alexandria,
to the end, not indeed of the civil broils, to which we see no issue,
but of Caesar's life. I wish that those who may read them could know how
unwillingly I
undertook to write them, as then I might the more readily escape the
imputation of folly and arrogance, in presuming to intrude among Caesar's
writings.
For it is agreed on all hands, that no composition was ever executed
with so great care, that it is not exceeded in elegance by these Commentaries,
which
were published for the use of historians, that they might not want
memoirs of such achievements; and they stand so high in the esteem of all
men, that
historians seem rather deprived of, than furnished with material. At
which we have more reason to be surprised than other men; for they can
only
appreciate the elegance and correctness with which he finished them,
while we know with what ease and expedition. Caesar possessed not only
an
uncommon flow of language and elegance of style, but also a thorough
knowledge of the method of conveying his ideas. But I had not even the
good
fortune to share in the Alexandrian or African war; and though these
were partly communicated to me by Caesar himself, in conversation, yet
we listen
with a different degree of attention to those things which strike us
with admiration by their novelty, and those which we design to attest to
posterity. But, in
truth, while I urge every apology, that I may not be compared to Caesar,
I incur the charge of vanity, by thinking it possible that I can in the
judgment of
any one be put in competition with him. Farewell.
<p align="justify"> Book 8 -- -(51-50 B.C.)
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.1": [8.1] Gaul being entirely reduced,
when Caesar having waged war incessantly during the former summer, wished
to recruit his soldiers
after so much fatigue, by repose in winter quarters, news was brought
him that several states were simultaneously renewing their hostile intention,
and
forming combinations. For which a probable reason was assigned; namely,
that the Gauls were convinced that they were not able to resist the Romans,
with any force they could collect in one place; and hoped that if several
states made war in different places at the same time, the Roman army would
neither have aid, nor time, nor forces, to prosecute them all: nor
ought any single state to decline any inconveniences that might befall
them, provided that
by such delay, the rest should be enabled to assert their liberty.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.2": [8.2] That this notion might not be
confirmed among the Gauls, Caesar left Marcus Antonius, his questor, in
charge of his quarters, and
set out himself with a guard of horse, the day before the kalends of
January, from the town Bibracte, to the thirteenth legion, which he had
stationed in the
country of the Bituriges, not far from the territories of the Aedui,
and joined to it the eleventh legion which was next it. Leaving two cohorts
to guard the
baggage, he leads the rest of his army into the most plentiful part
of the country of the Bituriges; who, possessing an extensive territory
and several towns,
were not to be deterred, by a single legion quartered among them, from
making warlike preparation, and forming combinations.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.3": [8.3] By Caesar's sudden arrival,
it happened, as it necessarily must, to an unprovided and dispersed people,
that they were surprised
by our horse, while cultivating the fields without any apprehensions,
before they had time to fly to their towns. For the usual sign of an enemy's
invasion,
which is generally intimated by the burning of their towns, was forbidden
by Caesar's orders; lest if he advanced far, forage and corn should become
scarce, or the enemy be warned by the fires to make their escape. Many
thousands being taken, as many of the Bituriges as were able to escape
the first
coming of the Romans, fled to the neighboring states, relying either
on private friendship, or public alliance. In vain; for Caesar, by hasty
marches,
anticipated them in every place, nor did he allow any state leisure
to consider the safety of others, in preference to their own. By this activity,
he both
retained his friends in their loyalty, and by fear, obliged the wavering
to accept offers of peace. Such offers being made to the Bituriges, when
they
perceived that through Caesar's clemency, an avenue was open to his
friendship, and that the neighboring states had given hostages, without
incurring any
punishment, and had been received under his protection, they did the
same.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.4": [8.4] Caesar promises his soldiers,
as a reward for their labor and patience, in cheerfully submitting to hardships
from the severity of the
winter, the difficulty of the roads, and the intolerable cold, two
hundred sestertii each, and to every centurian two thousand, to be given
instead of plunder:
and sending his legions back to quarters, he himself returned on the
fortieth day to Bibracte. While he was dispensing justice there, the Bituriges
send
embassadors to him, to entreat his aid against the Carnutes, who they
complained had made war against them. Upon this intelligence, though he
had not
remained more than eighteen days in winter quarters, he draws the fourteenth
and sixth legion out of quarters on the Saone, where he had posted them
as
mentioned in a former Commentary, to procure supplies of corn. With
these two legions he marches in pursuit of the Carnutes.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.5": [8.5] When the news of the approach
of our army reached the enemy, the Carnutes, terrified by the suffering
of other states, deserted
their villages and towns (which were small buildings, raised in a hurry,
to meet the immediate necessity, in which they lived to shelter themselves
against the
winter, for, being lately conquered, they had lost several towns),
and dispersed and fled. Caesar, unwilling to expose his soldiers to the
violent storms that
break out, especially at that season, took up his quarters at Genabum,
a town of the Carnutes; and lodged his men in houses, partly belonging
to the
Gauls, and partly built to shelter the tents, and hastily covered with
thatch. But the horse and auxiliaries he sends to all parts to which he
was told the
enemy had marched; and not without effect, as our men generally returned
loaded with booty. The Carnutes, overpowered by the severity of the winter,
and the fear of danger, and not daring to continue long in any place,
as they were driven from their houses, and not finding sufficient protection
in the
woods, from the violence of the storms, after losing a considerable
number of their men, disperse, and take refuge among the neighboring states.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.6": [8.6] Caesar, being contented, at
so severe a season, to disperse the gathering foes, and prevent any new
war from breaking out, and
being convinced, as far as reason could foresee, that no war of consequence
could be set on foot in the summer campaign, stationed Caius Trebonius,
with the two legions which he had with him, in quarters at Genabum:
and being informed by frequent embassies from the Remi, that the Bellovaci
(who
exceed all the Gauls and Belgae in military prowess), and the neighboring
states, headed by Correus, one of the Bellovaci, and Comius, the Atrebatian,
were raising an army, and assembling at a general rendezvous, designing
with their united forces to invade the territories of the Suessiones, who
were put
under the patronage of the Remi: and moreover, considering that not
only his honor, but his interest was concerned, that such of his allies,
as deserved well
of the republic, should suffer no calamity; he again draws the eleventh
legion out of quarters, and writes besides to Caius Fabius, to march with
his two
legions to the country of the Suessiones; and he sends to Trebonius
for one of his two legions. Thus, as far as the convenience of the quarters,
and the
management of the war admitted, he laid the burden of the expedition
on the legions by turns, without any intermission to his own toils.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.7": [8.7] As soon as his troops were collected,
he marched against the Bellovaci: and pitching his camp in their territories,
detached troops
of horse all round the country, to take prisoners, from whom he might
learn the enemy's plan. The horse, having executed his orders bring him
back word,
that but few were found in the houses: and that even these had not
stayed at home to cultivate their lands (for the emigration was general
from all parts) but
had been sent back to watch our motions. Upon Caesar's inquiring from
them, where the main body of the Bellovaci were posted, and what was their
design: they made answer, "that all the Bellovaci, fit for carrying
arms, had assembled in one place, and along with them the Ambiani, Aulerci,
Caletes,
Velocasses, and Atrebates, and that they had chosen for their camp,
an elevated position, surrounded by a dangerous morass: that they had conveyed
all
their baggage into the most remote woods: that several noblemen were
united in the management of the war; but that the people were most inclined
to be
governed by Correus, because they knew that he had the strongest aversion
to the name of the Roman people: that a few days before Comius had left
the
camp to engage the Germans to their aid whose nation bordered on theirs,
and whose numbers were countless: that the Bellovaci had come to a
resolution, with the consent of all the generals and the earnest desire
of the people, if Caesar should come with only three legions, as was reported,
to give
him battle, that they might not be obliged to encounter his whole army
on a future occasion, when they should be in a more wretched and distressed
condition; but if he brought a stronger force, they intended to remain
in the position they had chosen, and by ambuscade to prevent the Romans
from
getting forage (which at that season was both scarce and much scattered),
corn, and other necessaries.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.8": [8.8] When Caesar was convinced of
the truth of this account from the concurring testimony of several persons,
and perceived that the
plans which were proposed were full of prudence, and very unlike the
rash resolves of a barbarous people, he considered it incumbent on him
to use
every exertion, in order that the enemy might despise his small force
and come to an action. For he had three veteran legions of distinguished
valor, the
seventh, eighth and ninth. The eleventh consisted of chosen youth of
great hopes, who had served eight campaigns, but who, compared with the
others,
had not yet acquired any great reputation for experience and valor.
Calling therefore a council, and laying before it the intelligence which
he had received,
he encouraged his soldiers. In order if possible to entice the enemy
to an engagement by the appearance of only three legions, he ranged his
army in the
following manner, that the seventh, eighth, and ninth legions should
march before all the baggage; that then the eleventh should bring up the
rear of the
whole train of baggage (which however was but small, as is usual on
such expeditions), so that the enemy could not get a sight of a greater
number than
they themselves were willing to encounter. By this disposition he formed
his army almost into a square, and brought them within sight of the enemy
sooner
than was anticipated.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.9": [8.9] When the Gauls, whose bold resolutions
had been reported to Caesar, saw the legions advance with a regular motion,
drawn up
in battle array; either from the danger of an engagement, or our sudden
approach, or with the design of watching our movements, they drew up their
forces before the camp, and did not quit the rising ground. Though
Caesar wished to bring them to battle, yet being surprised to see so vast
a host of the
enemy, he encamped opposite to them, with a valley between them, deep
rather than extensive. He ordered his camp to be fortified with a rampart
twelve
feet high, with breastworks built on it proportioned to its height
and two trenches, each fifteen feet broad, with perpendicular sides to
be sunk: likewise
several turrets, three stories high, to be raised, with a communication
to each other by galleries laid across and covered over; which should be
guarded in
front by small parapets of osiers; that the enemy might be repulsed
by two rows of soldiers. The one of whom, being more secure from danger
by their
height might throw their darts with more daring and to a greater distance;
the other which was nearer the enemy, being stationed on the rampart, would
be
protected by their galleries from darts falling on their heads. At
the entrance he erected gates and turrets of a considerable height.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.10": [8.10] Caesar had a double design
in this fortification; for he both hoped that the strength of his works,
and his [apparent] fears would
raise confidence in the barbarians; and when there should be occasion
to make a distant excursion to get forage or corn, he saw that his camp
would be
secured by the works with a very small force. In the mean time there
were frequent skirmishes across the marsh, a few on both sides sallying
out between
the two camps. Sometimes, however, our Gallic or German auxiliaries
crossed the marsh, and furiously pursued the enemy; or on the other hand
the
enemy passed it and beat back our men. Moreover there happened in the
course of our daily foraging, what must of necessity happen, when corn
is to be
collected by a few scattered men out of private houses, that our foragers
dispersing in an intricate country were surrounded by the enemy; by which,
though we suffered but an inconsiderable loss of cattle and servants,
yet it raised foolish hopes in the barbarians; but more especially, because
Comius,
who I said had gone to get aid from the Germans, returned with some
cavalry, and though the Germans were only 500, yet the barbarians were
elated by
their arrival.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.11": [8.11] Caesar, observing that the
enemy kept for several days within their camp, which was well secured by
a morass and its natural
situation, and that it could not be assaulted without a dangerous engagement,
nor the place inclosed with lines without an addition to his army, wrote
to
Trebonius to send with all dispatch for the thirteenth legion which
was in winter quarters among the Bituriges under Titus Sextius, one of
his lieutenants;
and then to come to him by forced marches with the three legions. He
himself sent the cavalry of the Remi, and Lingones, and other states, from
whom he
had required a vast number, to guard his foraging parties, and to support
them in case of any sudden attack of the enemy.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.12": [8.12] As this continued for several
days, and their vigilance was relaxed by custom (an effect which is generally
produced by time),
the Bellovaci, having made themselves acquainted with the daily stations
of our horse, lie in ambush with a select body of foot in a place covered
with
woods; to it they sent their horse the next day, who were first to
decoy our men into the ambuscade, and then when they were surrounded, to
attack
them. It was the lot of the Remi to fall into this snare, to whom that
day had been allotted to perform this duty; for, having suddenly got sight
of the
enemy's cavalry, and despising their weakness, in consequence of their
superior numbers, they pursued them too eagerly, and were surrounded on
every
side by the foot. Being, by this means thrown into disorder they returned
with more precipitation than is usual in cavalry actions, with the loss
of Vertiscus
the governor of their state, and the general of their horse, who, though
scarcely able to sit on horseback through years, neither, in accordance
with the
custom of the Gauls, pleaded his age in excuse for not accepting the
command, nor would he suffer them to fight without him. The spirits of
the barbarians
were puffed up, and inflated at the success of this battle, in killing
the prince, and general of the Remi; and our men were taught by this loss,
to examine the
country, and post their guards with more caution, and to be more moderate
in pursuing a retreating enemy.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.13": [8.13] In the mean time daily skirmishes
take place continually in view of both camps; these were fought at the
ford and pass of the
morass. In one of these contests the Germans, whom Caesar had brought
over the Rhine, to fight, intermixed with the horse, having resolutely
crossed the
marsh, and slain the few who made resistance, and boldly pursued the
rest, so terrified them, that not only those who were attacked hand to
hand, or
wounded at a distance, but even those who were stationed at a greater
distance to support them, fled disgracefully; and being often beaten from
the rising
grounds, did not stop till they had retired into their camp, or some,
impelled by fear, had fled further. Their danger threw their whole army
into such
confusion, that it was difficult to judge whether they were more insolent
after a slight advantage or more dejected by a trifling calamity.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.14": [8.14] After spending several days
in the same camp, the guards of the Bellovaci, learning that Caius Trebonius
was advancing nearer
with his legions, and fearing a siege like that of Alesia, send off
by night all who were disabled by age or infirmity, or unarmed, and along
with them their
whole baggage. While they are preparing their disorderly and confused
troop for march (for the Gauls are always attended by a vast multitude
of wagons,
even when they have very light baggage), being overtaken by day-light,
they drew their forces out before their camp, to prevent the Romans attempting
a
pursuit before the line of their baggage had advanced to a considerable
distance. But Caesar did not think it prudent to attack them when standing
on their
defense, with such a steep hill in their favor, nor keep his legions
at such a distance that they could quit their post without danger: but,
perceiving that his
camp was divided from the enemy's by a deep morass, so difficult to
cross that he could not pursue with expedition, and that the hill beyond
the morass,
which extended almost to the enemy's camp, was separated from it only
by a small valley, he laid a bridge over the morass and led his army across,
and
soon reached the plain on the top of the hill, which was fortified
on either side by a steep ascent. Having there drawn up his army in order
of battle, he
marched to the furthest hill, from which he could, with his engines,
shower darts upon the thickest of the enemy.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.15": [8.15] The Gauls, confiding in the
natural strength of their position, though they would not decline an engagement
if the Romans
attempted to ascend the hill, yet dared not divide their forces into
small parties, lest they should be thrown into disorder by being dispersed,
and therefore
remained in order of battle. Caesar, perceiving that they persisted
in their resolution, kept twenty cohorts in battle array, and, measuring
out ground there
for a camp, ordered it to be fortified. Having completed his works,
he drew up his legions before the rampart and stationed the cavalry in
certain
positions, with their horses bridled. When the Bellovaci saw the Romans
prepared to pursue them, and that they could not wait the whole night,
or
continue longer in the same place without provisions, they formed the
following plan to secure a retreat. They handed to one another the bundles
of straw
and sticks on which they sat (for it is the custom of the Gauls to
sit when drawn up in order of battle, as has been asserted in former commentaries),
of
which they had great plenty in their camp, and piled them in the front
of their line; and at the close of the day, on a certain signal, set them
all on fire at one
and the same time. The continued blaze soon screened all their forces
from the sight of the Romans, which no sooner happened than the barbarians
fled
with the greatest precipitation.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.16": [8.16] Though Caesar could not perceive
the retreat of the enemy for the intervention of the fire, yet, suspecting
that they had adopted
that method to favor their escape, he made his legions advance, and
sent a party of horse to pursue them; but, apprehensive of an ambuscade,
and that the
enemy might remain in the same place and endeavor to draw our men into
a disadvantageous situation, he advances himself but slowly. The horse,
being
afraid to venture into the smoke and dense line of flame, and those
who were bold enough to attempt it being scarcely able to see their horse's
heads, gave
the enemy free liberty to retreat, through fear of an ambuscade. Thus
by a flight, full at once of cowardice and address, they advanced without
any loss
about ten miles, and encamped in a very strong position. From which,
laying numerous ambuscades, both of horse and foot, they did considerable
damage
to the Roman foragers.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.17": [8.17] After this had happened several
times, Caesar discovered from a certain prisoner, that Correus, the general
of the Bellovaci,
had selected six thousand of his bravest foot and a thousand horse,
with which he designed to lie in ambush in a place to which he suspected
the Romans
would send to look for forage, on account of the abundance of corn
and grass. Upon receiving information of their design Caesar drew out more
legions
than he usually did, and sent forward his cavalry as usual, to protect
the foragers. With these he intermixed a guard of light infantry, and himself
advanced
with the legions as fast as he could.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.18": [8.18] The Gauls, placed in ambush,
had chosen for the seat of action a level piece of ground, not more than
a mile in extent, inclosed
on every side by a thick wood or a very deep river, as by a toil, and
this they surrounded. Our men, apprised of the enemy's design, marched
in good
order to the ground, ready both in heart and hand to give battle, and
willing to hazard any engagement when the legions were at their back. On
their
approach, as Correus supposed that he had got an opportunity of effecting
his purpose, he at first shows himself with a small party and attacks the
foremost troops. Our men resolutely stood the charge, and did not crowd
together in one place, as commonly happens from surprise in engagements
between the horse, whose numbers prove injurious to themselves.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.19": [8.19] When by the judicious arrangement
of our forces only a few of our men fought by turns, and did not suffer
themselves to be
surrounded, the rest of the enemy broke out from the woods while Correus
was engaged. The battle was maintained in different parts with great vigor,
and continued for a long time undecided, till at length a body of foot
gradually advanced from the woods in order of battle and forced our horse
to give
ground: the light infantry, which were sent before the legions to the
assistance of the cavalry, soon came up, and, mixing with the horse, fought
with great
courage. The battle was for some time doubtful, but, as usually happens,
our men, who stood the enemy's first charge, became superior from this
very
circumstance that, though suddenly attacked from an ambuscade, they
had sustained no loss. In the mean time the legions were approaching, and
several
messengers arrived with notice to our men and the enemy that the [Roman]
general was near at hand, with his forces in battle array. Upon this intelligence,
our men, confiding in the support of the cohorts, fought most resolutely,
fearing, lest if they should be slow in their operations they should let
the legions
participate in the glory of the conquest. The enemy lose courage and
attempt to escape by different ways. In vain; for they were themselves
entangled in
that labyrinth in which they thought to entrap the Romans. Being defeated
and put to the rout, and having lost the greater part of their men, they
fled in
consternation whithersoever chance carried them; some sought the woods,
others the river, but were vigorously pursued by our men and put to the
sword.
Yet, in the mean time, Correus, unconquered by calamity, could not
be prevailed on to quit the field and take refuge in the woods, or accept
our offers of
quarter, but, fighting courageously and wounding several, provoked
our men, elated with victory, to discharge their weapons against him.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.20": [8.20] After this transaction, Caesar,
having come up immediately after the battle, and imagining that the enemy,
upon receiving the
news of so great a defeat, would be so depressed that they would abandon
their camp, which was not above eight miles distant from the scene of action,
though he saw his passage obstructed by the river, yet he marched his
army over and advanced. But the Bellovaci and the other states, being informed
of
the loss they had sustained by a few wounded men who having escaped
by the shelter of the woods, had returned to them after the defeat, and
learning
that every thing had turned out unfavorable, that Correus was slain,
and the horse and most valiant of their foot cut off, imagined that the
Romans were
marching against them, and calling a council in haste by sound of trumpet,
unanimously cry out to send embassadors and hostages to Caesar.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.21": [8.21] This proposal having met with
general approbation, Comius the Atrebatian fled to those Germans from whom
he had borrowed
auxiliaries for that war. The rest instantly send embassadors to Caesar;
and requested that he would be contented with that punishment of his enemy,
which if he had possessed the power to inflict on them before the engagement,
when they were yet uninjured, they were persuaded from his usual
clemency and mercy, he never would have inflicted; that the power of
the Bellovaci was crushed by the cavalry action; that many thousand of
their
choicest foot had fallen, that scarce a man had escaped to bring the
fatal news. That, however, the Bellovaci had derived from the battle one
advantage, of
some importance, considering their loss; that Correus, the author of
the rebellion, and agitator of the people, was slain: for that while he
lived the senate
had never equal influence in the state with the giddy populace.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.22": [8.22] Caesar reminded the embassadors
who made these supplications, that the Bellovaci had at the same season
the year before, in
conjunction with other states of Gaul, undertaken a war, and that they
had persevered the most obstinately of all in their purpose, and were not
brought to
a proper way of thinking by the submission of the rest: that he knew
and was aware that the guilt of a crime was easily transferred to the dead;
but that no
one person could have such influence, as to be able by the feeble support
of the multitude to raise a war and carry it on without the consent of
the nobles,
in opposition to the senate, and in despite of every virtuous man;
however he was satisfied with the punishment, which they had drawn upon
themselves.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.23": [8.23] The night following the embassadors
bring back his answer to their countrymen and prepare the hostages. Embassadors
flock
in from the other states, which were waiting for the issue of the [war
with the] Bellovaci: they give hostages, and receive his orders; all except
Comius,
whose fears restrained him from intrusting his safety to any person's
honor. For the year before, while Caesar was holding the assizes in Hither
Gaul, Titus
Labienus, having discovered that Comius was tampering with the state,
and raising a conspiracy against Caesar, thought he might punish his infidelity
without perfidy; but judging that he would not come to his camp at
his invitation, and unwilling to put him on his guard by the attempt, he
sent Caius
Volusenus Quadratus, with orders to have him put to death under pretense
of conference. To effect his purpose, he sent with him some chosen centurions.
When they came to the conference, and Volusenus, as had been agreed
on, had taken hold of Comius by the hand, and one of the centurions, as
if
surprised at so uncommon an incident, attempted to kill him, he was
prevented by the friends of Comius, but wounded him severely in the head
by the first
blow. Swords were drawn on both sides, not so much with a design to
fight as to effect an escape, our men believing that Comius had received
a mortal
stroke; and the Gauls, from the treachery which they had seen, dreading
that a deeper design lay concealed. Upon this transaction, it was said
that Comius
made a resolution never to come within sight of any Roman.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.24": [8.24] When Caesar, having completely
conquered the most warlike nations, perceived that there was now no state
which could
make preparations for war to oppose him, but that some were removing
and fleeing from their country to avoid present subjection, he resolved
to detach
his army into different parts of the country. He kept with himself
Marcus Antonius the quaestor, with the eleventh legion; Caius Fabius was
detached with
twenty-five cohorts into the remotest part of Gaul, because it was
rumored that some states had risen in arms, and he did not think that Caius
Caninius
Rebilus, who had the charge of that country, was strong enough to protect
it with two legions. He ordered Titus Labienus to attend himself, and sent
the
twelfth legion which had been under him in winter quarters, to Hither
Gaul, to protect the Roman colonies, and prevent any loss by the inroads
of
barbarians similar to that which had happened the year before to the
Tergestines, who were cut off by a sudden depredation and attack. He himself
marched to depopulate the country of Ambiorix, whom he had terrified
and forced to fly, but despaired of being able to reduce under his power;
but he
thought it most consistent with his honor to waste his country both
of inhabitants, cattle, and buildings, so that from the abhorrence of his
countrymen, if
fortune suffered any to survive, he might be excluded from a return
to his state for the calamities which he had brought on it.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.25": [8.25] After he had sent either his
legions or auxiliaries through every part of Ambiorix's dominions, and
wasted the whole country by
sword, fire, and rapine, and had killed or taken prodigious numbers,
he sent Labienus with two legions against the Treviri, whose state, from
its vicinity to
Germany, being engaged in constant war, differed but little from the
Germans, in civilization and savage barbarity; and never continued in its
allegiance,
except when awed by the presence of his army.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.26": [8.26] In the mean time Caius Caninius,
a lieutenant, having received information by letters and messages from
Duracius, who had
always continued in friendship to the Roman people, though a part of
his state had revolted, that a great multitude of the enemy were in arms
in the country
of the Pictones, marched to the town Limonum. When he was approaching
it, he was informed by some prisoners, that Duracius was shut up by several
thousand men, under the command of Dumnacus, general of the Andes,
and that Limonum was besieged, but not daring to face the enemy with his
weak
legions, he encamped in a strong position: Dumnacus, having notice
of Caninius's approach, turned his whole force against the legions, and
prepared to
assault the Roman camp. But after spending several days in the attempt,
and losing a considerable number of men, without being able to make a breach
in
any part of the works, he returned again to the siege of Limonum.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.27": [8.27] At the same time, Caius Fabius,
a lieutenant, brings back many states to their allegiance, and confirms
their submission by
taking hostages; he was then informed by letters from Caninius, of
the proceedings among the Pictones. Upon which he set off to bring assistance
to
Duracius. But Dumnacus, hearing of the approach of Fabius, and despairing
of safety, if at the same time he should be forced to withstand the Roman
army without, and observe, and be under apprehension from the town's
people, made a precipitate retreat from that place with all his forces.
Nor did he
think that he should be sufficiently secure from danger, unless he
led his army across the Loire, which was too deep a river to pass except
by a bridge.
Though Fabius had not yet come within sight of the enemy, nor joined
Caninius; yet being informed of the nature of the country, by persons acquainted
with it, he judged it most likely that the enemy would take that way,
which he found they did take. He therefore marched to that bridge with
his army, and
ordered his cavalry to advance no farther before the legions than that
they could return to the same camp at night, without fatiguing their horses.
Our horse
pursued according to orders, and fell upon Dumnacus's rear and attacking
them on their march, while fleeing, dismayed, and laden with baggage, they
slew a great number, and took a rich booty. Having executed the affair
so successfully, they retired to the camp.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.28": [8.28] The night following, Fabius
sent his horse before him, with orders to engage the enemy, and delay their
march till he himself
should come up. That his orders might be faithfully performed, Quintus
Atius Varus, general of the horse, a man of uncommon spirit and skill,
encouraged
his men, and pursuing the enemy, disposed some of his troops in convenient
places, and with the rest gave battle to the enemy. The enemy's cavalry
made
a bold stand, the foot relieving each other, and making a general halt,
to assist their horse against ours. The battle was warmly contested. For
our men,
despising the enemy whom they had conquered the day before, and knowing
that the legions were following them, animated both by the disgrace of
retreating, and a desire of concluding the battle expeditiously by
their own courage, fought most valiantly against the foot: and the enemy,
imagining that no
more forces would come against them, as they had experienced the day
before, thought they had got a favorable opportunity of destroying our
whole
cavalry.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.29": [8.29] After the conflict had continued
for some time with great violence, Dumnacus drew out his army in such a
manner, that the foot
should by turns assist the horse. Then the legions, marching in close
order, came suddenly in sight of the enemy. At this sight, the barbarian
horse were so
astonished, and the foot so terrified, that breaking through the line
of baggage, they betook themselves to flight with a loud shout, and in
great disorder.
But our horse, who a little before had vigorously engaged them, while
they made resistance, being elated with joy at their victory, raising a
shout on every
side, poured round them as they ran, and as long as their horses had
strength to pursue, or their arms to give a blow, so long did they continue
the
slaughter of the enemy in that battle, and having killed above twelve
thousand men in arms, or such as threw away their arms through fear, they
took their
whole train of baggage.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.30": [8.30] After this defeat, when it
was ascertained that Drapes, a Senonian (who in the beginning of the revolt
of Gaul had collected
from all quarters men of desperate fortunes, invited the slaves to
liberty, called in the exiles of the whole kingdom, given an asylum to
robbers, and
intercepted the Roman baggage and provisions), was marching to the
province with five thousand men, being all he could collect after the defeat,
and that
Luterius a Cadurcian who, as it has been observed in a former commentary,
had designed to make an attack on the Province in the first revolt of Gaul,
had formed a junction with him, Caius Caninius went in pursuit of them
with two legions, lest great disgrace might be incurred from the fears
or injuries
done to the Province by the depredations of a band of desperate men.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.31": [8.31] Caius Fabius set off with
the rest of the army to the Carnutes and those other states, whose force
he was informed, had served
as auxiliaries in that battle, which he fought against Dumnacus. For
he had no doubt that they would be more submissive after their recent sufferings,
but if
respite and time were given them, they might be easily excited by the
earnest solicitations of the same Dumnacus. On this occasion Fabius was
extremely
fortunate and expeditious in recovering the states. For the Carnutes,
who, though often harassed had never mentioned peace, submitted and gave
hostages: and the other states, which lie in the remotest parts of
Gaul, adjoining the ocean, and which are called Armoricae, influenced by
the example of
the Carnutes, as soon as Fabius arrived with his legions, without delay
comply with his command. Dumnacus, expelled from his own territories, wandering
and skulking about, was forced to seek refuge by himself in the most
remote parts of Gaul.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.32": [8.32] But Drapes in conjunction
with Luterius, knowing that Caninius was at hand with the legions, and
that they themselves could not
without certain destruction enter the boundaries of the province, while
an army was in pursuit of them, and being no longer at liberty to roam
up and down
and pillage, halt in the country of the Cadurci, as Luterius had once
in his prosperity possessed a powerful influence over the inhabitants,
who were his
countrymen, and being always the author of new projects, had considerable
authority among the barbarians; with his own and Drapes' troops he seized
Uxellodunum, a town formerly in vassalage to him, and strongly fortified
by its natural situation; and prevailed on the inhabitants to join him.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.33": [8.33] After Caninius had rapidly
marched to this place, and perceived that all parts of the town were secured
by very craggy rocks,
which it would be difficult for men in arms to climb even if they met
with no resistance; and moreover, observing that the town's people were
possessed of
effects, to a considerable amount, and that if they attempted to convey
them away in a clandestine manner, they could not escape our horse, or
even our
legions; he divided his forces into three parts, and pitched three
camps on very high ground, with the intention of drawing lines round the
town by degrees,
as his forces could bear the fatigue.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.34": [8.34] When the townsmen perceived
his design, being terrified by the recollection of the distress at Alesia,
they began to dread
similar consequences from a siege; and above all Luterius, who had
experienced that fatal event, cautioned them to make provisions of corn;
they
therefore resolve by general consent to leave part of their troops
behind, and set out with their light troops to bring in corn. The scheme
having met with
approbation, the following night Drapes and Luterius leaving two thousand
men in the garrison, marched out of the town with the rest. After a few
days'
stay in the country of the Cadurci (some of whom were disposed to assist
them with corn, and others were unable to prevent their taking it) they
collected
a great store. Sometimes also attacks were made on our little forts
by sallies at night. For this reason Caninius deferred drawing his works
round the
whole town, lest he should be unable to protect them when completed,
or by disposing his garrisons in several places, should make them too weak.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.35": [8.35] Drapes and Luterius, having
laid in a large supply of corn, occupying a position at about ten miles
distance from the town,
intending from it to convey the corn into the town by degrees. They
chose each his respective department. Drapes stayed behind in the camp
with part of
the army to protect it; Luterius conveys the train with provisions
into the town. Accordingly, having disposed guards here and there along
the road, about
the tenth hour of the night, he set out by narrow paths through the
woods, to fetch the corn into the town. But their noise being heard by
the sentinels of
our camp, and the scouts which we had sent out, having brought an account
of what was going on, Caninius instantly with the ready-armed cohorts from
the nearest turrets made an attack on the convoy at the break of day.
They, alarmed at so unexpected an evil, fled by different ways to their
guard: which
as soon as our men perceived, they fell with great fury on the escort,
and did not allow a single man to be taken alive. Luterius escaped thence
with a few
followers, but did not return to the camp.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.36": [8.36] After this success, Caninius
learned from some prisoners, that a part of the forces was encamped with
Drapes, not more than
ten miles off: which being confirmed by several, supposing that after
the defeat of one general, the rest would be terrified, and might be easily
conquered,
he thought it a most fortunate event that none of the enemy had fled
back from the slaughter to the camp, to give Drapes notice of the calamity
which had
befallen him. And as he could see no danger in making the attempt,
he sent forward all his cavalry and the German foot, men of great activity,
to the
enemy's camp. He divides one legion among the three camps, and takes
the other without baggage along with him. When he had advanced near the
enemy, he was informed by scouts, which he had sent before him, that
the enemy's camp, as is the custom of barbarians, was pitched low, near
the banks
of a river, and that the higher grounds were unoccupied: but that the
German horse had made a sudden attack on them, and had begun the battle.
Upon
this intelligence, he marched up with his legion, armed and in order
of battle. Then, on a signal being suddenly given on every side, our men
took
possession of the higher grounds. Upon this the German horse observing
the Roman colors, fought with great vigor. Immediately all the cohorts
attack
them on every side; and having either killed or made prisoners of them
all, gained great booty. In that battle, Drapes himself was taken prisoner.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.37": [8.37] Caninius, having accomplished
the business so successfully, without having scarcely a man wounded, returned
to besiege the
town; and, having destroyed the enemy without, for fear of whom he
had been prevented from strengthening his redoubts, and surrounding the
enemy with
his lines, he orders the work to be completed on every side. The next
day, Caius Fabius came to join him with his forces, and took upon him the
siege of
one side.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.38": [8.38] In the mean time, Caesar left
Caius Antonius in the country of the Bellovaci, with fifteen cohorts, that
the Belgae might have no
opportunity of forming new plans in future. He himself visits the other
states, demands a great number of hostages, and by his encouraging language
allays
the apprehensions of all. When he came to the Carnutes, in whose state
he has in a former commentary mentioned that the war first broke out; observing,
that from a consciousness of their guilt, they seemed to be in the
greatest terror: to relieve the state the sooner from its fear, he demanded
that Guturvatus,
the promoter of that treason, and the instigator of that rebellion,
should be delivered up to punishment. And though the latter did not dare
to trust his life
even to his own countrymen, yet such diligent search was made by them
all, that he was soon brought to our camp. Caesar was forced to punish
him, by
the clamors of the soldiers, contrary to his natural humanity, for
they alleged that all the dangers and losses incurred in that war, ought
to be imputed to
Guturvatus. Accordingly, he was whipped to death, and his head cut
off.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.39": [8.39] Here Caesar was informed by
numerous letters from Caninius of what had happened to Drapes and Luterius,
and in what
conduct the town's people persisted: and though he despised the smallness
of their numbers, yet he thought their obstinacy deserving a severe punishment,
lest Gaul in general should adopt an idea that she did not want strength
but perseverance to oppose the Romans; and lest the other states, relying
on the
advantage of situation, should follow their example and assert their
liberty; especially as he knew that all the Gauls understood that his command
was to
continue but one summer longer, and if they could hold out for that
time, that they would have no further danger to apprehend. He therefore
left Quintus
Calenus, one of his lieutenants, behind him, with two legions, and
instructions to follow him by regular marches. He hastened as much as he
could with all
the cavalry to Caninius.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.40": [8.40] Having arrived at Uxellodunum,
contrary to the general expectation, and perceiving that the town was surrounded
by the
works, and that the enemy had no possible means of retiring from the
assault, and being likewise informed by the deserters that the townsmen
had
abundance of corn, he endeavoured to prevent their getting water. A
river divided the valley below, which almost surrounded the steep craggy
mountain
on which Uxellodunum was built. The nature of the ground prevented
his turning the current: for it ran so low down at the foot of the mountain,
that no
drains could be sunk deep enough to draw it off in any direction. But
the descent to it was so difficult, that if we made opposition, the besieged
could
neither come to the river nor retire up the precipice without hazard
of their lives. Caesar perceiving the difficulty, disposed archers and
slingers, and in
some places, opposite to the easiest descents, placed engines, and
attempted to hinder the townsmen from getting water at the river, which
obliged them
afterward to go all to one place to procure water.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.41": [8.41] Close under the walls of the
town, a copious spring gushed out on that part, which for the space of
nearly three hundred feet,
was not surrounded by the river. While every other person wished that
the besieged could be debarred from this spring, Caesar alone saw that
it could be
effected, though not without great danger. Opposite to it he began
to advance the vineae toward the mountain, and to throw up a mound, with
great labor
and continual skirmishing. For the townsmen ran down from the high
ground, and fought without any risk, and wounded several of our men, yet
they
obstinately pushed on and were not deterred from moving forward the
vineae, and from surmounting by their assiduity the difficulties of situation.
At the
same time they work mines, and move the crates and vineae to the source
of the fountain. This was the only work which they could do without danger
or
suspicion. A mound sixty feet high was raised; on it was erected a
turret of ten stories, not with the intention that it should be on a level
with the wall (for
that could not be effected by any works), but to rise above the top
of the spring. When our engines began to play from it upon the paths that
led to the
fountain, and the townsmen could not go for water without danger, not
only the cattle designed for food and the working cattle, but a great number
of men
also died of thirst.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.42": [8.42] Alarmed at this calamity,
the townsmen fill barrels with tallow, pitch, and dried wood: these they
set on fire, and roll down on
our works. At the same time, they fight most furiously, to deter the
Romans, by the engagement and danger, from extinguishing the flames. Instantly
a great
blaze arose in the works. For whatever they threw down the precipice,
striking against the vineae and agger, communicated the fire to whatever
was in the
way. Our soldiers on the other hand, though they were engaged in a
perilous sort of encounter, and laboring under the disadvantages of position,
yet
supported all with very great presence of mind. For the action happened
in an elevated situation, and in sight of our army; and a great shout was
raised on
both sides; therefore every man faced the weapons of the enemy and
the flames in as conspicuous a manner as he could, that his valor might
be the better
known and attested.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.43": [8.43] Caesar, observing that several
of his men were wounded, ordered the cohorts to ascend the mountain on
all sides, and, under
pretense of assailing the walls, to raise a shout: at which the besieged
being frightened, and not knowing what was going on in other places, call
off their
armed troops from attacking our works, and dispose them on the walls.
Thus our men without hazarding a battle, gained time partly to extinguish
the
works which had caught fire, and partly to cut off the communication.
As the townsmen still continued to make an obstinate resistance, and even,
after
losing the greatest part of their forces by drought, persevered in
their resolution: at last the veins of the spring were cut across by our
mines, and turned
from their course. By this their constant spring was suddenly dried
up, which reduced them to such despair that they imagined that it was not
done by the
art of man, but the will of the gods; forced, therefore, by necessity,
they at length submitted.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.44": [8.44] Caesar, being convinced that
his lenity was known to all men, and being under no fears of being thought
to act severely from a
natural cruelty, and perceiving that there would be no end to his troubles
if several states should attempt to rebel in like manner and in different
places,
resolved to deter others by inflicting an exemplary punishment on these.
Accordingly he cut off the hands of those who had borne arms against him.
Their
lives he spared, that the punishment of their rebellion might be the
more conspicuous. Drapes, who I have said was taken by Caninius, either
through
indignation and grief arising from his captivity, or through fear of
severer punishments, abstained from food for several days, and thus perished.
At the
same time, Luterius, who, I have related, had escaped from the battle,
having fallen into the hands of Epasnactus, an Arvernian (for he frequently
changed
his quarters, and threw himself on the honor of several persons, as
he saw that he dare not remain long in one place, and was conscious how
great an
enemy he deserved to have in Caesar), was by this Epasnactus, the Arvernian,
a sincere friend of the Roman people, delivered without any hesitation,
a
prisoner to Caesar.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.45": [8.45] In the mean time, Labienus
engages in a successful cavalry action among the Treviri; and, having killed
several of them and of
the Germans, who never refused their aid to any person against the
Romans, he got their chiefs alive into his power, and, among them, Surus,
an Aeduan,
who was highly renowned both for his valor and birth, and was the only
Aeduan that had continued in arms till that time. Caesar, being informed
of this,
and perceiving that he had met with good success in all parts of Gaul,
and reflecting that, in former campaigns [Celtic] Gaul had been conquered
and
subdued; but that he had never gone in person to Aquitania, but had
made a conquest of it, in some degree, by Marcus Crassus, set out for it
with two
legions, designing to spend the latter part of the summer there. This
affair he executed with his usual dispatch and good fortune. For all the
states of
Aquitania sent embassadors to him and delivered hostages. These affairs
being concluded, he marched with a guard of cavalry toward Narbo, and drew
off his army into winter quarters by his lieutenants. He posted four
legions in the country of the Belgae, under Marcus Antonius, Caius Trebonius,
Publius
Vatinius, and Quintus Tullius, his lieutenants. Two he detached to
the Aedui, knowing them to have a very powerful influence throughout all
Gaul. Two he
placed among the Turoni, near the confines of the Carnutes, to keep
in awe the entire tract of country bordering on the ocean; the other two
he placed in
the territories of the Lemovices, at a small distance from the Arverni,
that no part of Gaul might be without an army. Having spent a few days
in the
province, he quickly ran through all the business of the assizes, settled
all public disputes, and distributed rewards to the most deserving; for
he had a good
opportunity of learning how every person was disposed toward the republic
during the general revolt of Gaul, which he had withstood by the fidelity
and
assistance of the Province.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.47": [8.47] Having finished these affairs,
he returned to his legions among the Belgae and wintered at Nemetocenna:
there he got
intelligence that Comius, the Atrebatian had had an engagement with
his cavalry. For when Antonius had gone into winter quarters, and the state
of the
Atrebates continued in their allegiance, Comius, who, after that wound
which I before mentioned, was always ready to join his countrymen upon
every
commotion, that they might not want a person to advise and head them
in the management of the war, when his state submitted to the Romans, supported
himself and his adherents on plunder by means of his cavalry, infested
the roads, and intercepted several convoys which were bringing provisions
to the
Roman quarters.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.48": [8.48] Caius Volusenus Quadratus
was appointed commander of the horse under Antonius, to winter with him:
Antonius sent him in
pursuit of the enemy's cavalry; now Volusenus added to that valor which
was pre-eminent in him, a great aversion to Comius, on which account he
executed the more willingly the orders which he received. Having, therefore,
laid ambuscades, he had several encounters with his cavalry and came off
successful. At last, when a violent contest ensued, and Volusenus,
through eagerness to intercept Comius, had obstinately pursued him with
a small party;
and Comius had, by the rapidity of his flight, drawn Volusenus to a
considerable distance from his troops, he, on a sudden, appealed to the
honor of all
about him for assistance not to suffer the wound, which he had perfidiously
received, to go without vengeance; and, wheeling his horse about, rode
unguardedly before the rest up to the commander. All his horse following
his example, made a few of our men turn their backs and pursued them. Comius,
clapping spurs to his horse, rode up to Volusenus, and, pointing his
lance, pierced him in the thigh with great force. When their commander
was wounded,
our men no longer hesitated to make resistance, and, facing about,
beat back the enemy. When this occurred, several of the enemy, repulsed
by the great
impetuosity of our men, were wounded, and some were trampled to death
in striving to escape, and some were made prisoners. Their general escaped
this misfortune by the swiftness of his horse. Our commander, being
severely wounded, so much so that he appeared to run the risk of losing
his life, was
carried back to the camp. But Comius, having either gratified his resentment,
or, because he had lost the greatest part of his followers, sent embassadors
to Antonius, and assured him that he would give hostages as a security
that he would go wherever Antonius should prescribe, and would comply with
his
orders, and only entreated that this concession should be made to his
fears, that he should not be obliged to go into the presence of any Roman.
As
Antonius judged that his request originated in a just apprehension,
he indulged him in it and accepted his hostages. Caesar, I know, has made
a separate
commentary of each year's transactions, which I have not thought it
necessary for me to do, because the following year, in which Lucius Paulus
and Caius
Marcellus were consuls, produced no remarkable occurrences in Gaul.
But that no person may be left in ignorance of the place where Caesar and
his
army were at that time, have thought proper to write a few words in
addition to this commentary.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.49": [8.49] Caesar, while in winter quarters
in the country of the Belgae, made it his only business to keep the states
in amity with him, and
to give none either hopes of, or pretext for a revolt. For nothing
was further from his wishes than to be under the necessity of engaging
in another war at
his departure; lest, when he was drawing his army out of the country,
any war should be left unfinished, which the Gauls would cheerfully undertake,
when
there was no immediate danger. Therefore, by treating the states with
respect, making rich presents to the leading men, imposing no new burdens,
and
making the terms of their subjection lighter, he easily kept Gaul (already
exhausted by so many unsuccessful battles) in obedience.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.50": [8.50] When the winter quarters were
broken up he himself, contrary to his usual practice, proceeded to Italy,
by the longest possible
stages, in order to visit the free towns and colonies, that he might
recommend to them the petition of Marcus Antonius, his treasurer, for the
priesthood.
For he exerted his interest both cheerfully in favor of a man strongly
attached to him, whom he had sent home before him to attend the election,
and
zealously to oppose the faction and power of a few men, who, by rejecting
Marcus Antonius, wished to undermine Caesar's influence when going out
of
office. Though Caesar heard on the road, before he reached Italy that
he was created augur, yet he thought himself in honor bound to visit the
free towns
and colonies, to return them thanks for rendering such service to Antonius
by their presence in such great numbers [at the election], and at the same
time
to recommend to them himself, and his honor in his suit for the consulate
the ensuing year. For his adversaries arrogantly boasted that Lucius Lentulus
and
Caius Marcellus had been appointed consuls, who would strip Caesar
of all honor and dignity: and that the consulate had been injuriously taken
from
Sergius Galba, though he had been much superior in votes and interest,
because he was united to Caesar, both by friendship, and by serving as
lieutenant
under him.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.51": [8.51] Caesar, on his arrival, was
received by the principal towns and colonies with incredible respect and
affection; for this was the
first time he came since the war against united Gaul. Nothing was omitted
which could be thought of for the ornament of the gates, roads, and every
place
through which Caesar was to pass. All the people with their children
went out to meet him. Sacrifices were offered up in every quarter. The
market places
and temples were laid out with entertainments, as if anticipating the
joy of a most splendid triumph. So great was the magnificence of the richer
and zeal of
the poorer ranks of the people.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.52": [8.52] When Caesar had gone through
all the states of Cisalpine Gaul, he returned with the greatest haste to
the army at
Nemetocenna; and having ordered all his legions to march from winter
quarters to the territories of the Treviri, he went thither and reviewed
them. He
made Titus Labienus governor of Cisalpine Gaul, that he might be the
more inclined to support him in his suit for the consulate. He himself
made such
journeys as he thought would conduce to the health of his men by change
of air; and though he was frequently told that Labienus was solicited by
his
enemies, and was assured that a scheme was in agitation by the contrivance
of a few, that the senate should interpose their authority to deprive him
of a
part of his army; yet he neither gave credit to any story concerning
Labienus, nor could be prevailed upon to do any thing in opposition to
the authority of
the senate; for he thought that his cause would be easily gained by
the free voice of the senators. For Caius Curio, one of the tribunes of
the people,
having undertaken to defend Caesar's cause and dignity, had often proposed
to the senate, "that if the dread of Caesar's arms rendered any apprehensive,
as Pompey's authority and arms were no less formidable to the forum,
both should resign their command, and disband their armies. That then the
city
would be free, and enjoy its due rights." And he not only proposed
this, but of himself called upon the senate to divide on the question.
But the consuls
and Pompey's friends interposed to prevent it; and regulating matters
as they desired, they broke up the meeting.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.53": [8.53] This testimony of the unanimous
voice of the senate was very great, and consistent with their former conduct;
for the preceding
year, when Marcellus attacked Caesar's dignity, he proposed to the
senate, contrary to the law of Pompey and Crassus, to dispose of Caesar's
province,
before the expiration of his command, and when the votes were called
for, and Marcellus, who endeavored to advance his own dignity, by raising
envy
against Caesar, wanted a division, the full senate went over to the
opposite side. The spirit of Caesar's foes was not broken by this, but
it taught them, that
they ought to strengthen their interest by enlarging their connections,
so as to force the senate to comply with whatever they had resolved on.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.54": [8.54] After this a decree was passed
by the senate, that one legion should be sent by Pompey, and another by
Caesar, to the
Parthian war. But these two legions were evidently drawn from Caesar
alone. For the first legion which Pompey sent to Caesar, he gave Caesar,
as if it
belonged to himself, though it was levied in Caesar's province. Caesar,
however, though no one could doubt the design of his enemies, sent the
legion
back to Cneius Pompey, and in compliance with the decree of the senate,
ordered the fifteenth, belonging to himself, and which was quartered in
Cisalpine
Gaul, to be delivered up. In its room he sent the thirteenth into Italy,
to protect the garrisons from which he had drafted the fifteenth. He disposed
his army
in winter quarters, placed Caius Trebonius, with four legions among
the Belgae, and detached Caius Fabius, with four more, to the Aedui; for
he thought
that Gaul would be most secure, if the Belgae, a people of the greatest
valor, and the Aedui, who possessed the most powerful influence, were kept
in
awe by his armies.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.8.55": [8.55] He himself set out for Italy;
where he was informed on his arrival, that the two legions sent home by
him, and which by the
senate's decree, should have been sent to the Parthian war, had been
delivered over to Pompey, by Caius Marcellus the consul, and were retained
in
Italy. Although from this transaction it was evident to every one that
war was designed against Caesar, yet he resolved to submit to any thing,
as long as
there were hopes left of deciding the dispute in an equitable manner,
rather than to have recourse to arms.
