<p align="justify"> 55 B.C.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.1": [4.1] The following winter (this was
the year in which Cn. Pompey and M. Crassus were consuls), those Germans
[called] the Usipetes,
and likewise the Tenchtheri, with a great number of men, crossed the
Rhine, not far from the place at which that river discharges itself into
the sea. The
motive for crossing [that river] was, that having been for several
years harassed by the Suevi, they were constantly engaged in war, and hindered
from the
pursuits of agriculture. The nation of the Suevi is by far the largest
and the most warlike nation of all the Germans. They are said to possess
a hundred
cantons, from each of which they yearly send from their territories
for the purpose of war a thousand armed men: the others who remain at home,
maintain
[both] themselves and those-engaged in the expedition. The latter again,
in their turn, are in arms the year after: the former remain at home. Thus
neither
husbandry, nor the art and practice of war are neglected. But among
them there exists no private and separate land; nor are they permitted
to remain more
than one year in one place for the purpose of residence. They do not
live much on corn, but subsist for the most part on milk and flesh, and
are much
[engaged] in hunting; which circumstance must, by the nature of their
food, and by their daily exercise and the freedom of their life (for having
from
boyhood been accustomed to no employment, or discipline, they do nothing
at all contrary to their inclination), both promote their strength and
render
them men of vast stature of body. And to such a habit have they brought
themselves, that even in the coldest parts they wear no clothing whatever
except
skins, by reason of the scantiness of which, a great portion of their
body is bare, and besides they bathe in open rivers.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.2": [4.2] Merchants have access to them
rather that they may have persons to whom they may sell those things which
they have taken in
war, than because they need any commodity to be imported to them. Moreover,
even as to laboring cattle, in which the Gauls take the greatest pleasure,
and which they procure at a great price, the Germans do not employ
such as are imported, but those poor and ill-shaped animals, which belong
to their
country; these, however, they render capable of the greatest labor
by daily exercise. In cavalry actions they frequently leap from their horses
and fight on
foot; and train their horses to stand still in the very spot on which
they leave them, to which they retreat with great activity when there is
occasion; nor,
according to their practice, is any thing regarded as more unseemly,
or more unmanly, than to use housings. Accordingly, they have the courage,
though
they be themselves but few, to advance against any number whatever
of horse mounted with housings. They on no account permit wine to be imported
to
them, because they consider that men degenerate in their powers of
enduring fatigue, and are rendered effeminate by that commodity.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.3": [4.3] They esteem it their greatest
praise as a nation, that the lands about their territories lie unoccupied
to a very great extent, inasmuch
as [they think] that by this circumstance is indicated, that a great
number of nations can not withstand their power; and thus on one side of
the Suevi the
lands are said to lie desolate for about six hundred miles. On the
other side they border on the Ubii, whose state was large and flourishing,
considering the
condition of the Germans, and who are somewhat more refined than those
of the same race and the rest [of the Germans], and that because they border
on the Rhine, and are much resorted to by merchants, and are accustomed
to the manners of the Gauls, by reason of their approximity to them. Though
the Suevi, after making the attempt frequently and in several wars,
could not expel this nation from their territories, on account of the extent
and population
of their state, yet they made them tributaries, and rendered them less
distinguished and powerful [than they had ever been].
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.4": [4.4] In the same condition were the
Usipetes and the Tenchtheri (whom we have mentioned above), who, for many
years, resisted the
power of the Suevi, but being at last driven from their possessions,
and having wandered through many parts of Germany, came to the Rhine, to
districts
which the Menapii inhabited, and where they had lands, houses, and
villages on either side of the river. The latter people, alarmed by the
arrival of so great
a multitude, removed from those houses which they had on the other
side of the river, and having placed guards on this side the Rhine, proceeded
to
hinder the Germans from crossing. They, finding themselves, after they
had tried all means, unable either to force a passage on account of their
deficiency
in shipping, or cross by stealth on account of the guards of the Menapii,
pretended to return to their own settlements and districts; and, after
having
proceeded three days' march, returned; and their cavalry having performed
the whole of this journey in one night, cut off the Menapii, who were ignorant
of, and did not expect [their approach, and] who, having moreover been
informed of the departure of the Germans by their scouts, had, without
apprehension, returned to their villages beyond the Rhine. Having slain
these, and seized their ships, they crossed the river before that part
of the Menapii,
who were at peace in their settlements over the Rhine, were apprized
of [their intention]; and seizing all their houses, maintained themselves
upon their
provisions during the rest of the winter.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.5": [4.5] Caesar, when informed of these
matters, fearing the fickle disposition of the Gauls, who are easily prompted
to take up
resolutions, and much addicted to change, considered that nothing was
to be intrusted to them; for it is the custom of that people to compel
travelers to
stop, even against their inclination, and inquire what they may have
heard, or may know, respecting any matter; and in towns the common people
throng
around merchants and force them to state from what countries they come,
and what affairs they know of there. They often engage in resolutions
concerning the most important matters, induced by these reports and
stories alone; of which they must necessarily instantly repent, since they
yield to mere
unauthorized reports; and since most people give to their questions
answers framed agreeably to their wishes.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.6": [4.6] Caesar, being aware of their
custom, in order that he might not encounter a more formidable war, sets
forward to the army earlier
in the year than he was accustomed to do. When he had arrived there,
he discovered that those things, which he had suspected would occur, had
taken
place; that embassies had been sent to the Germans by some of the states,
and that they had been entreated to leave the Rhine, and had been promised
that all things which they desired should be provided by the Gauls.
Allured by this hope, the Germans were then making excursions to greater
distances,
and had advanced to the territories of the Eburones and the Condrusi,
who are under the protection of the Treviri. After summoning the chiefs
of Gaul,
Caesar thought proper to pretend ignorance of the things which he had
discovered; and having conciliated and confirmed their minds, and ordered
some
cavalry to be raised, resolved to make war against the Germans.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.7": [4.7] Having provided corn and selected
his cavalry, he began to direct his march toward those parts in which he
heard the Germans
were. When he was distant from them only a few days' march, embassadors
came to him from their state, whose speech was as follows: "That the
Germans neither make war upon the Roman people first, nor do they decline,
if they are provoked, to engage with them in arms; for that this was the
custom of the Germans handed down to them from their forefathers, -to
resist whatsoever people make war upon them and not to avert it by entreaty;
this, however, they confessed,-that they had come hither reluctantly,
having been expelled from their country. If the Romans were disposed to
accept their
friendship, they might be serviceable allies to them; and let them
either assign them lands, or permit them to retain those which they had
acquired by their
arms; that they are inferior to the Suevi alone, to whom not even the
immortal gods can show themselves equal; that there was none at all besides
on earth
whom they could not conquer."
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.8": [4.8] To these remarks Caesar replied
in such terms as he thought proper; but the conclusion of his speech was,
"That he could make
no alliance with them, if they continued in Gaul; that it was not probable
that they who were not able to defend their own territories, should get
possession
of those of others, nor were there any lands lying waste in Gaul, which
could be given away, especially to so great a number of men, without doing
wrong
[to others]; but they might, if they were desirous, settle in the territories
of the Ubii; whose embassadors were then with him, and were complaining
of the
aggressions of the Suevi, and requesting assistance from him; and that
he would obtain this request from them."
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.9": [4.9] The embassadors said that they
would report these things to their country men; and, after having deliberated
on the matter, would
return to Caesar after the third day, they begged that he would not
in the mean time advance his camp nearer to them. Caesar said that he could
not grant
them even that; for he had learned that they had sent a great part
of their cavalry over the Meuse to the Ambivariti, some days before, for
the purpose of
plundering and procuring forage. He supposed that they were then waiting
for these horse, and that the delay was caused on this account.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.10": [4.10] The Meuse rises from mount
Le Vosge, which is in the territories of the Lingones; and, having received
a branch of the Rhine,
which is called the Waal, forms the island of the Batavi, and not more
than eighty miles from it it falls into the ocean. But the Rhine takes
its source among
the Lepontii, who inhabit the Alps, and is carried with a rapid current
for a long distance through the territories of the Sarunates, Helvetii,
Sequani,
Mediomatrici, Tribuci, and Treviri, and when it approaches the ocean,
divides into several branches; and, having formed many and extensive islands,
a
great part of which are inhabited by savage and barbarous nations (of
whom there are some who are supposed to live on fish and the eggs of sea-fowl),
flows into the ocean by several mouths.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.11": [4.11] When Caesar was not more than
twelve miles distant from the enemy, the embassadors return to him, as
had been arranged;
who meeting him on the march, earnestly entreated him not to advance
any further. When they could not obtain this, they begged him to send on
a
dispatch to those who had marched in advance of the main army, and
forbid them to engage; and grant them permission to send embassadors to
the Ubii,
and if the princes and senate of the latter would give them security
by oath, they assured Caesar that they would accept such conditions as
might be
proposed by him; and requested that he would give them the space of
three days for negociating these affairs. Caesar thought that these things
tended to
the self-same point [as their other proposal]; [namely] that, in consequence
of a delay of three days intervening, their horse, which were at a distance,
might return; however, he said, that he would not that day advance
further than four miles for the purpose of procuring water; he ordered
that they should
assemble at that place in as large a number as possible, the following
day, that he might inquire into their demands. In the mean time he sends
messengers
to the officers who had marched in advance with all the cavalry, to
order them not to provoke the enemy to an engagement, and if they themselves
were
assailed, to sustain the attack until he came up with the army.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.12": [4.12] But the enemy, as soon as
they saw our horse, the number of which was 5000, whereas they themselves
had not more than
800 horse, because those which had gone over the Meuse for the purpose
of foraging had not returned, while our men had no apprehensions, because
their embassadors had gone away from Caesar a little before, and that
day had been requested by them as a period of truce, made an onset on our
men,
and soon threw them into disorder. When our men, in their turn, made
a stand, they, according to their practice, leaped from their horses to
their feet, and
stabbing our horses in the belly and overthrowing a great many of our
men, put the rest to flight, and drove them forward so much alarmed that
they did
not desist from their retreat till they had come in sight of our army.
In that encounter seventy-four of our horse were slain; among them, Piso,
an
Aquitanian, a most valiant man, and descended from a very illustrious
family; whose grandfather had held the sovereignty of his state, and had
been styled
friend by our senate. He, while he was endeavoring to render assistance
to his brother who was surrounded by the enemy, and whom he rescued from
danger, was himself thrown from his horse, which was wounded under
him, but still opposed [his antagonists] with the greatest intrepidity,
as long as he
was able to maintain the conflict. When at length he fell, surrounded
on all sides and after receiving many wounds, and his brother, who had
then retired
from the fight, observed it from a distance, he spurred on his horse,
threw himself upon the enemy, and was killed.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.13": [4.13] After this engagement, Caesar
considered that neither ought embassadors to be received to audience, nor
conditions be
accepted by him from those who, after having sued for peace by way
of stratagem and treachery, had made war without provocation. And to wait
until
the enemy's forces were augmented and their cavalry had returned, he
concluded, would be the greatest madness; and knowing the fickleness of
the
Gauls, he felt how much influence the enemy had already acquired among
them by this one skirmish. He [therefore] deemed that no time for concerting
measures ought to be afforded them. After having resolved on those
things and communicated his plans to his lieutenants and quaestor in order
that he
might not suffer any opportunity for engaging to escape him, a very
seasonable event occurred, namely, that on the morning of the next day,
a large body
of Germans, consisting of their princes and old men, came to the camp
to him to practice the same treachery and dissimulation; but, as they asserted,
for
the purpose of acquitting themselves for having engaged in a skirmish
the day before, contrary to what had been agreed and to what indeed, they
themselves had requested; and also if they could by any means obtain
a truce by deceiving him. Caesar, rejoicing that they had fallen into his
power,
ordered them to be detained. He then drew all his forces out of the
camp, and commanded the cavalry, because he thought they were intimidated
by the
late skirmish, to follow in the rear.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.14": [4.14] Having marshalled his army
in three lines, and in a short time performed a march of eight miles, he
arrived at the camp of the
enemy before the Germans could perceive what was going on; who being
suddenly alarmed by all the circumstances, both by the speediness of our
arrival
and the absence of their own officers, as time was afforded neither
for concerting measures nor for seizing their arms, are perplexed as to
whether it would
be better to lead out their forces against the enemy, or to defend
their camp, or seek their safety by flight. Their consternation being made
apparent by
their noise and tumult, our soldiers, excited by the treachery of the
preceding day, rushed into the camp: such of them as could readily get
their arms, for a
short time withstood our men, and gave battle among their carts and
baggage wagons; but the rest of the people, [consisting] of boys and women
(for they
had left their country and crossed the Rhine with all their families)
began to fly in all directions; in pursuit of whom Caesar sent the cavalry.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.15": [4.15] The Germans when, upon hearing
a noise behind them, [they looked and] saw that their families were being
slain, throwing
away their arms and abandoning their standards, fled out of the camp,
and when they had arrived at the confluence of the Meuse and the Rhine,
the
survivors despairing of further escape, as a great number of their
countrymen had been killed, threw themselves into the river and there perished,
overcome by fear, fatigue, and the violence of the stream. Our soldiers,
after the alarm of so great a war, for the number of the enemy amounted
to
430,000, returned to their camp, all safe to a man, very few being
even wounded. Caesar granted those whom he had detained in the camp liberty
of
departing. They however, dreading revenge and torture from the Gauls,
whose lands they had harassed, said that they desired to remain with him.
Caesar
granted them permission.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.16": [4.16] The German war being finished,
Caesar thought it expedient for him to cross the Rhine, for many reasons;
of which this was the
most weighty, that, since he saw the Germans were so easily urged to
go into Gaul, he desired they should have their fears for their own territories,
when
they discovered that the army of the Roman people both could and dared
pass the Rhine. There was added also, that portion of the cavalry of the
Usipetes and the Tenchtheri, which I have above related to have crossed
the Meuse for the purpose of plundering and procuring forage, and was not
present at the engagement, had betaken themselves, after the retreat
of their countrymen, across the Rhine into the territories of the Sigambri,
and united
themselves to them. When Caesar sent embassadors to them, to demand
that they should give up to him those who had made war against him and
against
Gaul, they replied, "That the Rhine bounded the empire of the Roman
people; if he did not think it just for the Germans to pass over into Gaul
against his
consent, why did he claim that any thing beyond the Rhine should be
subject to his dominion or power?" The Ubii, also, who alone, out of all
the nations
lying beyond the Rhine, had sent embassadors to Caesar, and formed
an alliance and given hostages, earnestly entreated "that he would bring
them
assistance, because they were grievously oppressed by the Suevi; or,
if he was prevented from doing so by the business of the commonwealth,
he would
at least transport his army over the Rhine; that that would be sufficient
for their present assistance and their hope for the future; that so great
was the name
and the reputation of his army, even among the most remote nations
of the Germans, arising from the defeat of Ariovistus and this last battle
which was
fought, that they might be safe under the fame and friendship of the
Roman people." They promised a large number of ships for transporting the
army.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.17": [4.17] Caesar, for those reasons
which I have mentioned, had resolved to cross the Rhine; but to cross by
ships he neither deemed to
be sufficiently safe, nor considered consistent with his own dignity
or that of the Roman people. Therefore, although the greatest difficulty
in forming a
bridge was presented to him, on account of the breadth, rapidity, and
depth of the river, he nevertheless considered that it ought to be attempted
by him,
or that his army ought not otherwise to be led over. He devised this
plan of a bridge. He joined together at the distance of two feet, two piles,
each a foot
and a half thick, sharpened a little at the lower end, and proportioned
in length, to the depth of the river. After he had, by means of engines,
sunk these
into the river, and fixed them at the bottom, and then driven them
in with rammers, not quite perpendicularly, dike a stake, but bending forward
and
sloping, so as to incline in the direction of the current of the river;
he also placed two [other piles] opposite to these, at the distance of
forty feet lower
down, fastened together in the same manner, but directed against the
force and current of the river. Both these, moreover, were kept firmly
apart by
beams two feet thick (the space which the binding of the piles occupied),
laid in at their extremities between two braces on each side, and in consequence
of these being in different directions and fastened on sides the one
opposite to the other, so great was the strength of the work, and such
the arrangement
of the materials, that in proportion as the greater body of water dashed
against the bridge, so much the closer were its parts held fastened together.
These
beams were bound together by timber laid over them, in the direction
of the length of the bridge, and were [then] covered over with laths and
hurdles; and
in addition to this, piles were driven into the water obliquely, at
the lower side of the bridge, and these, serving as buttresses, and being
connected with
every portion of the work, sustained the force of the stream: and there
were others also above the bridge, at a moderate distance; that if trunks
of trees or
vessels were floated down the river by the barbarians for the purpose
of destroying the work, the violence of such things might be diminished
by these
defenses, and might not injure the bridge.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.18": [4.18] Within ten days after the
timber began to be collected, the whole work was completed, and the whole
army led over. Caesar,
leaving a strong guard at each end of the bridge, hastens into the
territories of the Sigambri. In the mean time, embassadors from several
nations come to
him, whom, on their suing for peace and alliance, he answers in a courteous
manner, and orders hostages to be brought to him. But the Sigambri, at
the
very time the bridge was begun to be built, made preparations for a
flight (by the advice of such of the Tenchtheri and Usipetes as they had
among them),
and quitted their territories, and conveyed away all their possessions,
and concealed themselves in deserts and woods.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.19": [4.19] Caesar, having remained in
their territories a few days, and burned all their villages and houses,
and cut down their corn,
proceeded into the territories of the Ubii; and having promised them
his assistance, if they were ever harassed by the Suevi, he learned from
them these
particulars: that the Suevi, after they had by means of their scouts
found that the bridge was being built, had called a council, according
to their custom,
and sent orders to all parts of their state to remove from the towns
and convey their children, wives, and all their possessions into the woods,
and that all
who could bear arms should assemble in one place; that the place thus
chosen was nearly the centre of those regions which the Suevi possessed;
that in
this spot they had resolved to await the arrival of the Romans, and
give them battle there. When Caesar discovered this, having already accomplished
all
these things on account of which he had resolved to lead his army over,
namely, to strike fear into the Germans, take vengeance on the Sigambri,
and free
the Ubii from the invasion of the Suevi, having spent altogether eighteen
days beyond the Rhine, and thinking he had advanced far enough to serve
both
honor and interest, he returned into Gaul, and cut down the bridge.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.20": [4.20] During the short part of summer
which remained, Caesar, although in these countries, as all Gaul lies toward
the north, the
winters are early, nevertheless resolved to proceed into Britain, because
he discovered that in almost all the wars with the Gauls succors had been
furnished to our enemy from that country; and even if the time of year
should be insufficient for carrying on the war, yet he thought it would
be of great
service to him if he only entered the island, and saw into the character
of the people, and got knowledge of their localities, harbors, and landing-places,
all
which were for the most part unknown to the Gauls. For neither does
any one except merchants generally go thither, nor even to them was any
portion of
it known, except the sea-coast and those parts which are opposite to
Gaul. Therefore, after having called up to him the merchants from all parts,
he could
learn neither what was the size of the island, nor what or how numerous
were the nations which inhabited it, nor what system of war they followed,
nor
what customs they used, nor what harbors were convenient for a great
number of large ships.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.21": [4.21] He sends before him Caius
Volusenus with a ship of war, to acquire a knowledge of these particulars
before he in person
should make a descent into the island, as he was convinced that this
was a judicious measure. He commissioned him to thoroughly examine into
all
matters, and then return to him as soon as possible. He himself proceeds
to the Morini with all his forces. He orders ships from all parts of the
neighboring
countries, and the fleet which the preceding summer he had built for
the war with the Veneti, to assemble in this place. In the mean time, his
purpose
having been discovered, and reported to the Britons by merchants, embassadors
come to him from several states of the island, to promise that they will
give hostages, and submit to the government of the Roman people. Having
given them an audience, he after promising liberally, and exhorting them
to
continue in that purpose, sends them back to their own country, and
[dispatches] with them Commius, whom, upon subduing the Atrebates, he had
created king there, a man whose courage and conduct he esteemed, and
who he thought would be faithful to him, and whose influence ranked highly
in
those countries. He orders him to visit as many states as he could,
and persuade them to embrace the protection of the Roman people, and apprize
them
that he would shortly come thither. Volusenus, having viewed the localities
as far as means could be afforded one who dared not leave his ship and
trust
himself to barbarians, returns to Caesar on the fifth day, and reports
what he had there observed.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.22": [4.22] While Caesar remains in these
parts for the purpose of procuring ships, embassadors come to him from
a great portion of the
Morini, to plead their excuse respecting their conduct on the late
occasion; alleging that it was as men uncivilized, and as those who were
unacquainted
with our custom, that they had made war upon the Roman people, and
promising to perform what he should command. Caesar, thinking that this
had
happened fortunately enough for him, because he neither wished to leave
an enemy behind him, nor had an opportunity for carrying on a war, by reason
of
the time of year, nor considered that employment in such trifling matters
was to be preferred to his enterprise on Britain, imposes a large number
of
hostages; and when these were brought, he received them to his protection.
Having collected together, and provided about eighty transport ships, as
many
as he thought necessary for conveying over two legions, he assigned
such [ships] of war as he had besides to the quaestor, his lieutenants,
and officers of
cavalry. There were in addition to these eighteen ships of burden which
were prevented, eight miles from that place, by winds, from being able
to reach
the same port. These he distributed among the horse; the rest of the
army, he delivered to Q. Titurius Sabinus and L. Aurunculeius Cotta, his
lieutenants,
to lead into the territories of the Menapii and those cantons of the
Morini from which embassadors had not come to him. He ordered P. Sulpicius
Rufus,
his lieutenant, to hold possession of the harbor, with such a garrison
as he thought sufficient.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.23": [4.23] These matters being arranged,
finding the weather favorable for his voyage, he set sail about the third
watch, and ordered the
horse to march forward to the further port, and there embark and follow
him. As this was performed rather tardily by them, he himself reached Britain
with the first squadron of ships, about the fourth hour of the day,
and there saw the forces of the enemy drawn up in arms on all the hills.
The nature of the
place was this: the sea was confined by mountains so close to it that
a dart could be thrown from their summit upon the shore. Considering this
by no
means a fit place for disembarking, he remained at anchor till the
ninth hour, for the other ships to arrive there. Having in the mean time
assembled the
lieutenants and military tribunes, he told them both what he had learned
from Volusenus, and what he wished to be done; and enjoined them (as the
principle of military matters, and especially as maritime affairs,
which have a precipitate and uncertain action, required) that all things
should be performed
by them at a nod and at the instant. Having dismissed them, meeting
both with wind and tide favorable at the same time, the signal being given
and the
anchor weighed, he advanced about seven miles from that place, and
stationed his fleet over against an open and level shore.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.24": [4.24] But the barbarians, upon perceiving
the design of the Romans, sent forward their cavalry and charioteers, a
class of warriors of
whom it is their practice to make great use in their battles, and following
with the rest of their forces, endeavored to prevent our men landing. In
this was
the greatest difficulty, for the following reasons, namely, because
our ships, on account of their great size, could be stationed only in deep
water; and our
soldiers, in places unknown to them, with their hands embarrassed,
oppressed with a large and heavy weight of armor, had at the same time
to leap from
the ships, stand amid the waves, and encounter the enemy; whereas they,
either on dry ground, or advancing a little way into the water, free in
all their
limbs in places thoroughly known to them, could confidently throw their
weapons and spur on their horses, which were accustomed to this kind of
service.
Dismayed by these circumstances and altogether untrained in this mode
of battle, our men did not all exert the same vigor and eagerness which
they had
been wont to exert in engagements on dry ground.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.25": [4.25] When Caesar observed this,
he ordered the ships of war, the appearance of which was somewhat strange
to the barbarians
and the motion more ready for service, to be withdrawn a little from
the transport vessels, and to be propelled by their oars, and be stationed
toward the
open flank of the enemy, and the enemy to be beaten off and driven
away, with slings, arrows, and engines: which plan was of great service
to our men;
for the barbarians being startled by the form of our ships and the
motions of our oars and the nature of our engines, which was strange to
them, stopped,
and shortly after retreated a little. And while our men were hesitating
[whether they should advance to the shore], chiefly on account of the depth
of the
sea, he who carried the eagle of the tenth legion, after supplicating
the gods that the matter might turn out favorably to the legion, exclaimed,
"Leap, fellow
soldiers, unless you wish to betray your eagle to the enemy. I, for
my part, will perform my duty to the commonwealth and my general." When
he had said
this with a loud voice, he leaped from the ship and proceeded to bear
the eagle toward the enemy. Then our men, exhorting one another that so
great a
disgrace should not be incurred, all leaped from the ship. When those
in the nearest vessels saw them, they speedily followed and approached
the enemy.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.26": [4.26] The battle was maintained
vigorously on both sides. Our men, however, as they could neither keep
their ranks, nor get firm
footing, nor follow their standards, and as one from one ship and another
from another assembled around whatever standards they met, were thrown
into
great confusion. But the enemy, who were acquainted with all the shallows,
when from the shore they saw any coming from a ship one by one, spurred
on
their horses, and attacked them while embarrassed; many surrounded
a few, others threw their weapons upon our collected forces on their exposed
flank.
When Caesar observed this, he ordered the boats of the ships of war
and the spy sloops to be filled with soldiers, and sent them up to the
succor of those
whom he had observed in distress. Our men, as soon as they made good
their footing on dry ground, and all their comrades had joined them, made
an
attack upon the enemy, and put them to flight, but could not pursue
them very far, because the horse had not been able to maintain their course
at sea and
reach the island. This alone was wanting to Caesar's accustomed success.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.27": [4.27] The enemy being thus vanquished
in battle, as soon as they recovered after their flight, instantly sent
embassadors to Caesar to
negotiate about peace. They promised to give hostages and perform what
he should command. Together with these embassadors came Commius the
Altrebatian, who, as I have above said, had been sent by Caesar into
Britain. Him they had seized upon when leaving his ship, although in the
character of
embassador he bore the general's commission to them, and thrown into
chains: then after the battle was fought, they sent him back, and in suing
for peace
cast the blame of that act upon the common people, and entreated that
it might be pardoned on account of their indiscretion. Caesar, complaining,
that
after they had sued for peace, and had voluntarily sent embassadors
into the continent for that purpose, they had made war without a reason,
said that he
would pardon their indiscretion, and imposed hostages, a part of whom
they gave immediately; the rest they said they would give in a few days,
since they
were sent for from remote places. In the mean time they ordered their
people to return to the country parts, and the chiefs assembled from all
quarter, and
proceeded to surrender themselves and their states to Caesar.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.28": [4.28] A peace being established
by these proceedings four days after we had come into Britain, the eighteen
ships, to which reference
has been made above, and which conveyed the cavalry, set sail from
the upper port with a gentle gale, when, however, they were approaching
Britain and
were seen from the camp, so great a storm suddenly arose that none
of them could maintain their course at sea; and some were taken back to
the same
port from which they had started;-others, to their great danger, were
driven to the lower part of the island, nearer to the west; which, however,
after
having cast anchor, as they were getting filled with water, put out
to sea through necessity in a stormy night, and made for the continent.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.29": [4.29] It happened that night to
be full moon, which usually occasions very high tides in that ocean; and
that circumstance was
unknown to our men. Thus, at the same time, the tide began to fill
the ships of war which Caesar had provided to convey over his army, and
which he had
drawn up on the strand; and the storm began to dash the ships of burden
which were riding at anchor against each other; nor was any means afforded
our
men of either managing them or of rendering any service. A great many
ships having been wrecked, inasmuch as the rest, having lost their cables,
anchors,
and other tackling, were unfit for sailing, a great confusion, as would
necessarily happen, arose throughout the army; for there were no other
ships in which
they could be conveyed back, and all things which are of service in
repairing vessels were wanting, and, corn for the winter had not been provided
in
those places, because it was understood by all that they would certainly
winter in Gaul.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.30": [4.30] On discovering these things
the chiefs of Britain, who had come up after the battle was fought to perform
those conditions
which Caesar had imposed, held a conference, when they perceived that
cavalry, and ships, and corn were wanting to the Romans, and discovered
the
small number of our soldiers from the small extent of the camp (which,
too, was on this account more limited than ordinary, because Caesar had
conveyed
over his legions without baggage), and thought that the best plan was
to renew the war, and cut off our men from corn and provisions and protract
the
affair till winter; because they felt confident, that, if they were
vanquished or cut off from a return, no one would afterward pass over into
Britain for the
purpose of making war. Therefore, again entering into a conspiracy,
they began to depart from the camp by degrees and secretly bring up their
people
from the country parts.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.31": [4.31] But Caesar, although he had
not as yet discovered their measures, yet, both from what had occurred
to his ships, and from the
circumstance that they had neglected to give the promised hostages,
suspected that the thing would come to pass which really did happen. He
therefore
provided remedies against all contingencies; for he daily conveyed
corn from the country parts into the camp, used the timber and brass of
such ships as
were most seriously damaged for repairing the rest, and ordered whatever
things besides were necessary for this object to be brought to him from
the
continent. And thus, since that business was executed by the soldiers
with the greatest energy, he effected that, after the loss of twelve ships,
a voyage
could be made well enough in the rest.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.32": [4.32] While these things are being
transacted, one legion had been sent to forage, according to custom, and
no suspicion of war had
arisen as yet, and some of the people remained in the country parts,
others went backward and forward to the camp, they who were on duty at
the gates
of the camp reported to Caesar that a greater dust than was usual was
seen in that direction in which the legion had marched. Caesar, suspecting
that
which was [really the case],-that some new enterprise was undertaken
by the barbarians, ordered the two cohorts which were on duty, to march
into that
quarter with him, and two other cohorts to relieve them on duty; the
rest to be armed and follow him immediately. When he had advanced some
little way
from the camp, he saw that his men were overpowered by the enemy and
scarcely able to stand their ground, and that, the legion being crowded
together,
weapons were being cast on them from all sides. For as all the corn
was reaped in every part with the exception of one, the enemy, suspecting
that our
men would repair to that, had concealed themselves in the woods during
the night. Then attacking them suddenly, scattered as they were, and when
they
had laid aside their arms, and were engaged in reaping, they killed
a small number, threw the rest into confusion, and surrounded them with
their cavalry
and chariots.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.33": [4.33] Their mode of fighting with
their chariots is this: firstly, they drive about in all directions and
throw their weapons and generally
break the ranks of the enemy with the very dread of their horses and
the noise of their wheels; and when they have worked themselves in between
the
troops of horse, leap from their chariots and engage on foot. The charioteers
in the mean time withdraw some little distance from the battle, and so
place
themselves with the chariots that, if their masters are overpowered
by the number of the enemy, they may have a ready retreat to their own
troops. Thus
they display in battle the speed of horse, [together with] the firmness
of infantry; and by daily practice and exercise attain to such expertness
that they are
accustomed, even on a declining and steep place, to check their horses
at full speed, and manage and turn them in an instant and run along the
pole, and
stand on the yoke, and thence betake themselves with the greatest celerity
to their chariots again.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.34": [4.34] Under these circumstances,
our men being dismayed by the novelty of this mode of battle, Caesar most
seasonably brought
assistance; for upon his arrival the enemy paused, and our men recovered
from their fear; upon which thinking the time unfavorable for provoking
the
enemy and coming to an action, he kept himself in his own quarter,
and, a short time having intervened, drew back the legions into the camp.
While these
things are going on, and all our men engaged, the rest of the Britons,
who were in the fields, departed. Storms then set in for several successive
days,
which both confined our men to the camp and hindered the enemy from
attacking us. In the mean time the barbarians dispatched messengers to
all parts,
and reported to their people the small number of our soldiers, and
how good an opportunity was given for obtaining spoil and for liberating
themselves
forever, if they should only drive the Romans from their camp. Having
by these means speedily got together a large force of infantry and of cavalry
they
came up to the camp.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.35": [4.35] Although Caesar anticipated
that the same thing which had happened on former occasions would then occur-that,
if the enemy
were routed, they would escape from danger by their speed; still, having
got about thirty horse, which Commius the Atrebatian, of whom mention has
been made, had brought over with him [from Gaul], he drew up the legions
in order of battle before the camp. When the action commenced, the enemy
were unable to sustain the attack of our men long, and turned their
backs; our men pursued them as far as their speed and strength permitted,
and slew a
great number of them; then, having destroyed and burned every thing
far and wide, they retreated to their camp.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.36": [4.36] The same day, embassadors
sent by the enemy came to Caesar to negotiate a peace. Caesar doubled the
number of hostages
which he had before demanded; and ordered that they should be brought
over to the continent, because, since the time of the equinox was near,
he did
not consider that, with his ships out of repair, the voyage ought to
be deferred till winter. Having met with favorable weather, he set sail
a little after
midnight, and all his fleet arrived safe at the continent, except two
of the ships of burden which could not make the same port which the other
ships did,
and were carried a little lower down.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.37": [4.37] When our soldiers, about 300
in number, had been drawn out of these two ships, and were marching to
the camp, the Morini,
whom Caesar, when setting forth for Britain, had left in a state of
peace, excited by the hope of spoil, at first surrounded them with a small
number of men,
and ordered them to lay down their arms, if they did not wish to be
slain; afterward however, when they, forming a circle, stood on their defense,
a shout
was raised and about 6000 of the enemy soon assembled; which being
reported, Caesar sent all the cavalry in the camp as a relief to his men.
In the mean
time our soldiers sustained the attack of the enemy, and fought most
valiantly for more than four hours, and, receiving but few wounds themselves,
slew
several of them. But after our cavalry came in sight, the enemy, throwing
away their arms, turned their backs, and a great number of them were killed.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.4.38": [4.38] The day following Caesar sent
Labienus, his lieutenant, with those legions which he had brought back
from Britain, against the
Morini, who had revolted; who, as they had no place to which they might
retreat, on account of the drying up of their marshes (which they had availed
themselves of as a place of refuge the preceding year), almost all
fell into the power of Labienus. In the mean time Caesar's lieutenants,
Q. Titurius and L.
Cotta, who had led the legions into the territories of the Menapii,
having laid waste all their lands, cut down their corn and burned their
houses, returned to
Caesar because the Menapii had all concealed themselves in their thickest
woods. Caesar fixed the winter quarters of all the legions among the Belgae.
Thither only two British states sent hostages; the rest omitted to
do so. For these successes, a thanksgiving of twenty days was decreed by
the senate
upon receiving Caesar's letter.
