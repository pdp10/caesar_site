<p align="justify"> 58 B.C.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.1": [1.1] All Gaul is divided into three
parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, those who
in their own language are
called Celts, in our Gauls, the third. All these differ from each other
in language, customs and laws. The river Garonne separates the Gauls from
the
Aquitani; the Marne and the Seine separate them from the Belgae. Of
all these, the Belgae are the bravest, because they are furthest from the
civilization
and refinement of [our] Province, and merchants least frequently resort
to them, and import those things which tend to effeminate the mind; and
they are
the nearest to the Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine, with whom they
are continually waging war; for which reason the Helvetii also surpass
the rest
of the Gauls in valor, as they contend with the Germans in almost daily
battles, when they either repel them from their own territories, or themselves
wage
war on their frontiers. One part of these, which it has been said that
the Gauls occupy, takes its beginning at the river Rhone; it is bounded
by the river
Garonne, the ocean, and the territories of the Belgae; it borders,
too, on the side of the Sequani and the Helvetii, upon the river Rhine,
and stretches
toward the north. The Belgae rises from the extreme frontier of Gaul,
extend to the lower part of the river Rhine; and look toward the north
and the rising
sun. Aquitania extends from the river Garonne to the Pyrenaean mountains
and to that part of the ocean which is near Spain: it looks between the
setting
of the sun, and the north star.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.2": [1.2] Among the Helvetii, Orgetorix
was by far the most distinguished and wealthy. He, when Marcus Messala
and Marcus Piso were
consuls, incited by lust of sovereignty, formed a conspiracy among
the nobility, and persuaded the people to go forth from their territories
with all their
possessions, [saying] that it would be very easy, since they excelled
all in valor, to acquire the supremacy of the whole of Gaul. To this he
the more easily
persuaded them, because the Helvetii, are confined on every side by
the nature of their situation; on one side by the Rhine, a very broad and
deep river,
which separates the Helvetian territory from the Germans; on a second
side by the Jura, a very high mountain, which is [situated] between the
Sequani and
the Helvetii; on a third by the Lake of Geneva, and by the river Rhone,
which separates our Province from the Helvetii. From these circumstances
it
resulted, that they could range less widely, and could less easily
make war upon their neighbors; for which reason men fond of war [as they
were] were
affected with great regret. They thought, that considering the extent
of their population, and their renown for warfare and bravery, they had
but narrow
limits, although they extended in length 240, and in breadth 180 [Roman]
miles.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.3": [1.3] Induced by these considerations,
and influenced by the authority of Orgetorix, they determined to provide
such things as were
necessary for their expedition-to buy up as great a number as possible
of beasts of burden and wagons-to make their sowings as large as possible,
so that
on their march plenty of corn might be in store-and to establish peace
and friendship with the neighboring states. They reckoned that a term of
two years
would be sufficient for them to execute their designs; they fix by
decree their departure for the third year. Orgetorix is chosen to complete
these
arrangements. He took upon himself the office of embassador to the
states: on this journey he persuades Casticus, the son of Catamantaledes
(one of the
Sequani, whose father had possessed the sovereignty among the people
for many years, and had been styled "friend" by the senate of the Roman
people),
to seize upon the sovereignty in his own state, which his father had
held before him, and he likewise persuades Dumnorix, an Aeduan, the brother
of
Divitiacus, who at that time possessed the chief authority in the state,
and was exceedingly beloved by the people, to attempt the same, and gives
him his
daughter in marriage. He proves to them that to accomplish their attempts
was a thing very easy to be done, because he himself would obtain the
government of his own state; that there was no doubt that the Helvetii
were the most powerful of the whole of Gaul; he assures them that he will,
with his
own forces and his own army, acquire the sovereignty for them. Incited
by this speech, they give a pledge and oath to one another, and hope that,
when
they have seized the sovereignty, they will, by means of the three
most powerful and valiant nations, be enabled to obtain possession of the
whole of Gaul.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.4": [1.4] When this scheme was disclosed
to the Helvetii by informers, they, according to their custom, compelled
Orgetorix to plead his
cause in chains; it was the law that the penalty of being burned by
fire should await him if condemned. On the day appointed for the pleading
of his cause,
Orgetorix drew together from all quarters to the court, all his vassals
to the number of ten thousand persons; and led together to the same place
all his
dependents and debtor-bondsmen, of whom he had a great number; by means
of those he rescued himself from [the necessity of] pleading his cause.
While the state, incensed at this act, was endeavoring to assert its
right by arms, and the magistrates were mustering a large body of men from
the country,
Orgetorix died; and there is not wanting a suspicion, as the Helvetii
think, of his having committed suicide.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.5": [1.5] After his death, the Helvetii
nevertheless attempt to do that which they had resolved on, namely, to
go forth from their territories.
When they thought that they were at length prepared for this undertaking,
they set fire to all their towns, in number about twelve-to their villages
about four
hundred-and to the private dwellings that remained; they burn up all
the corn, except what they intend to carry with them; that after destroying
the hope of
a return home, they might be the more ready for undergoing all dangers.
They order every one to carry forth from home for himself provisions for
three
months, ready ground. They persuade the Rauraci, and the Tulingi, and
the Latobrigi, their neighbors, to adopt the same plan, and after burning
down their
towns and villages, to set out with them: and they admit to their party
and unite to themselves as confederates the Boii, who had dwelt on the
other side of
the Rhine, and had crossed over into the Norican territory, and assaulted
Noreia.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.6": [1.6] There were in all two routes,
by which they could go forth from their country one through the Sequani
narrow and difficult,
between Mount Jura and the river Rhone (by which scarcely one wagon
at a time could be led; there was, moreover, a very high mountain overhanging,
so that a very few might easily intercept them; the other, through
our Province, much easier and freer from obstacles, because the Rhone flows
between
the boundaries of the Helvetii and those of the Allobroges, who had
lately been subdued, and is in some places crossed by a ford. The furthest
town of the
Allobroges, and the nearest to the territories of the Helvetii, is
Geneva. From this town a bridge extends to the Helvetii. They thought that
they should
either persuade the Allobroges, because they did not seem as yet well-affected
toward the Roman people, or compel them by force to allow them to pass
through their territories. Having provided every thing for the expedition,
they appoint a day, on which they should all meet on the bank of the Rhone.
This
day was the fifth before the kalends of April [i.e. the 28th of March],
in the consulship of Lucius Piso and Aulus Gabinius [B.C. 58.]
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.7": [1.7] When it was reported to Caesar
that they were attempting to make their route through our Province he hastens
to set out from the
city, and, by as great marches as he can, proceeds to Further Gaul,
and arrives at Geneva. He orders the whole Province [to furnish] as great
a number of
soldiers as possible, as there was in all only one legion in Further
Gaul: he orders the bridge at Geneva to be broken down. When the Helvetii
are
apprized of his arrival they send to him, as embassadors, the most
illustrious men of their state (in which embassy Numeius and Verudoctius
held the chief
place), to say "that it was their intention to march through the Province
without doing any harm, because they had" [according to their own
representations,] "no other route: that they requested, they might
be allowed to do so with his consent." Caesar, inasmuch as he kept in remembrance
that
Lucius Cassius, the consul, had been slain, and his army routed and
made to pass under the yoke by the Helvetii, did not think that [their
request] ought to
be granted: nor was he of opinion that men of hostile disposition,
if an opportunity of marching through the Province were given them, would
abstain from
outrage and mischief. Yet, in order that a period might intervene,
until the soldiers whom he had ordered [to be furnished] should assemble,
he replied to
the ambassadors, that he would take time to deliberate; if they wanted
any thing, they might return on the day before the ides of April [on April
12th].
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.8": [1.8] Meanwhile, with the legion which
he had with him and the soldiers which had assembled from the Province,
he carries along for
nineteen [Roman, not quite eighteen English] miles a wall, to the height
of sixteen feet, and a trench, from the Lake of Geneva, which flows into
the river
Rhone, to Mount Jura, which separates the territories of the Sequani
from those of the Helvetii. When that work was finished, he distributes
garrisons, and
closely fortifies redoubts, in order that he may the more easily intercept
them, if they should attempt to cross over against his will. When the day
which he
had appointed with the embassadors came, and they returned to him;
he says, that he can not, consistently with the custom and precedent of
the Roman
people, grant any one a passage through the Province; and he gives
them to understand, that, if they should attempt to use violence he would
oppose
them. The Helvetii, disappointed in this hope, tried if they could
force a passage (some by means of a bridge of boats and numerous rafts
constructed for
the purpose; others, by the fords of the Rhone, where the depth of
the river was least, sometimes by day, but more frequently by night), but
being kept at
bay by the strength of our works, and by the concourse of the soldiers,
and by the missiles, they desisted from this attempt.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.9": [1.9] There was left one way, [namely]
through the Sequani, by which, on account of its narrowness, they could
not pass without the
consent of the Sequani. As they could not of themselves prevail on
them, they send embassadors to Dumnorix the Aeduan, that through his intercession,
they might obtain their request from the Sequani. Dumnorix, by his
popularity and liberality, had great influence among the Sequani, and was
friendly to the
Helvetii, because out of that state he had married the daughter of
Orgetorix; and, incited by lust of sovereignty, was anxious for a revolution,
and wished
to have as many states as possible attached to him by his kindness
toward them. He, therefore, undertakes the affair, and prevails upon the
Sequani to
allow the Helvetii to march through their territories, and arranges
that they should give hostages to each other-the Sequani not to obstruct
the Helvetii in
their march-the Helvetii, to pass without mischief and outrage.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.10": [1.10] It is again told Caesar, that
the Helvetii intended to march through the country of the Sequani and the
Aedui into the territories
of the Santones, which are not far distant from those boundaries of
the Tolosates, which [viz. Tolosa, Toulouse] is a state in the Province.
If this took
place, he saw that it would be attended with great danger to the Province
to have warlike men, enemies of the Roman people, bordering upon an open
and very fertile tract of country. For these reasons he appointed Titus
Labienus, his lieutenant, to the command of the fortification which he
had made. He
himself proceeds to Italy by forced marches, and there levies two legions,
and leads out from winter-quarters three which were wintering around Aquileia,
and with these five legions marches rapidly by the nearest route across
the Alps into Further Gaul. Here the Centrones and the Graioceli and the
Caturiges, having taken possession of the higher parts, attempt to
obstruct the army in their march. After having routed these in several
battles, he arrives
in the territories of the Vocontii in the Further Province on the seventh
day from Ocelum, which is the most remote town of the Hither Province;
thence he
leads his army into the country of the Allobroges, and from the Allobroges
to the Segusiani. These people are the first beyond the Province on the
opposite side of the Rhone.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.11": [1.11] The Helvetii had by this time
led their forces over through the narrow defile and the territories of
the Sequani, and had arrived
at the territories of the Aedui, and were ravaging their lands. The
Aedui, as they could not defend themselves and their possessions against
them, send
embassadors to Caesar to ask assistance, [pleading] that they had at
all times so well deserved of the Roman people, that their fields ought
not to have
been laid waste-their children carried off into slavery-their towns
stormed, almost within sight of our army. At the same time the Ambarri,
the friends and
kinsmen of the Aedui, apprize Caesar, that it was not easy for them,
now that their fields had been devastated, to ward off the violence of
the enemy from
their towns: the Allobroges likewise, who had villages and possessions
on the other side of the Rhone, betake themselves in flight to Caesar,
and assure
him that they had nothing remaining, except the soil of their land.
Caesar, induced by these circumstances, decides, that he ought not to wait
until the
Helvetii, after destroying all the property of his allies, should arrive
among the Santones.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.12": [1.12] There is a river [called]
the Saone, which flows through the territories of the Aedui and Sequani
into the Rhone with such
incredible slowness, that it can not be determined by the eye in which
direction it flows. This the Helvetii were crossing by rafts and boats
joined together.
When Caesar was informed by spies that the Helvetii had already conveyed
three parts of their forces across that river, but that the fourth part
was left
behind on this side of the Saone, he set out from the camp with three
legions during the third watch, and came up with that division which had
not yet
crossed the river. Attacking them encumbered with baggage, and not
expecting him, he cut to pieces a great part of them; the rest betook themselves
to
flight, and concealed themselves in the nearest woods. That canton
[which was cut down] was called the Tigurine; for the whole Helvetian state
is divided
into four cantons. This single canton having left their country, within
the recollection of our fathers, had slain Lucius Cassius the consul, and
had made his
army pass under the yoke. Thus, whether by chance, or by the design
of the immortal gods, that part of the Helvetian state which had brought
a signal
calamity upon the Roman people, was the first to pay the penalty. In
this Caesar avenged not only the public but also his own personal wrongs,
because
the Tigurini had slain Lucius Piso the lieutenant [of Cassius], the
grandfather of Lucius Calpurnius Piso, his [Caesar's] father-in-law, in
the same battle as
Cassius himself.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.13": [1.13] This battle ended, that he
might be able to come up with the remaining forces of the Helvetii, he
procures a bridge to be made
across the Saone, and thus leads his army over. The Helvetii, confused
by his sudden arrival, when they found that he had effected in one day,
what they,
themselves had with the utmost difficulty accomplished in twenty namely,
the crossing of the river, send embassadors to him; at the head of which
embassy
was Divico, who had been commander of the Helvetii, in the war against
Cassius. He thus treats with Caesar:-that, "if the Roman people would make
peace with the Helvetii they would go to that part and there remain,
where Caesar might appoint and desire them to be; but if he should persist
in
persecuting them with war that he ought to remember both the ancient
disgrace of the Roman people and the characteristic valor of the Helvetii.
As to his
having attacked one canton by surprise, [at a time] when those who
had crossed the river could not bring assistance to their friends, that
he ought not on
that account to ascribe very much to his own valor, or despise them;
that they had so learned from their sires and ancestors, as to rely more
on valor than
on artifice and stratagem. Wherefore let him not bring it to pass that
the place, where they were standing, should acquire a name, from the disaster
of the
Roman people and the destruction of their army or transmit the remembrance
[of such an event to posterity]."
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.14": [1.14] To these words Caesar thus
replied:-that "on that very account he felt less hesitation, because he
kept in remembrance those
circumstances which the Helvetian embassadors had mentioned, and that
he felt the more indignant at them, in proportion as they had happened
undeservedly to the Roman people: for if they had been conscious of
having done any wrong, it would not have been difficult to be on their
guard, but for
that very reason had they been deceived, because neither were they
aware that any offense had been given by them, on account of which they
should be
afraid, nor did they think that they ought to be afraid without cause.
But even if he were willing to forget their former outrage, could he also
lay aside the
remembrance of the late wrongs, in that they had against his will attempted
a route through the Province by force, in that they had molested the Aedui,
the
Ambarri, and the Allobroges? That as to their so insolently boasting
of their victory, and as to their being astonished that they had so long
committed their
outrages with impunity, [both these things] tended to the same point;
for the immortal gods are wont to allow those persons whom they wish to
punish for
their guilt sometimes a greater prosperity and longer impunity, in
order that they may suffer the more severely from a reverse of circumstances.
Although
these things are so, yet, if hostages were to be given him by them
in order that he may be assured these will do what they promise, and provided
they will
give satisfaction to the Aedui for the outrages which they had committed
against them and their allies, and likewise to the Allobroges, he [Caesar]
will
make peace with them." Divico replied, that "the Helvetii had been
so trained by their ancestors, that they were accustomed to receive, not
to give
hostages; of that fact the Roman people were witness." Having given
this reply, he withdrew.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.15": [1.15] On the following day they
move their camp from that place; Caesar does the same, and sends forward
all his cavalry, to the
number of four thousand (which he had drawn together from all parts
of the Province and from the Aedui and their allies), to observe toward
what parts
the enemy are directing their march. These, having too eagerly pursued
the enemy's rear, come to a battle with the cavalry of the Helvetii in
a
disadvantageous place, and a few of our men fall. The Helvetii, elated
with this battle, because they had with five hundred horse repulsed so
large a body
of horse, began to face us more boldly, sometimes too from their rear
to provoke our men by an attack. Caesar [however] restrained his men from
battle,
deeming it sufficient for the present to prevent the enemy from rapine,
forage, and depredation. They marched for about fifteen days in such a
manner that
there was not more than five or six miles between the enemy's rear
and our van.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.16": [1.16] Meanwhile, Caesar kept daily
importuning the Aedui for the corn which they had promised in the name
of their state; for, in
consequence of the coldness (Gaul, being as before said, situated toward
the north), not only was the corn in the fields not ripe, but there was
not in store
a sufficiently large quantity even of fodder: besides he was unable
to use the corn which he had conveyed in ships up the river Saone, because
the Helvetii,
from whom he was unwilling to retire had diverted their march from
the Saone. The Aedui kept deferring from day to day, and saying that it
was being
collected-brought in-on the road." When he saw that he was put off
too long, and that the day was close at hand on which he ought to serve
out the corn
to his soldiers;-having called together their chiefs, of whom he had
a great number in his camp, among them Divitiacus and Liscus who was invested
with
the chief magistracy (whom the Aedui style the Vergobretus, and who
is elected annually and has power of life or death over his countrymen),
he severely
reprimands them, because he is not assisted by them on so urgent an
occasion, when the enemy were so close at hand, and when [corn] could neither
be
bought nor taken from the fields, particularly as, in a great measure
urged by their prayers, he had undertaken the war; much more bitterly,
therefore does
he complain of his being forsaken.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.17": [1.17] Then at length Liscus, moved
by Caesar's speech, discloses what he had hitherto kept secret:-that there
are some whose
influences with the people is very great, who, though private men,
have more power than the magistrates themselves: that these by seditions
and violent
language are deterring the populace from contributing the corn which
they ought to supply; [by telling them] that, if they can not any longer
retain the
supremacy of Gaul, it were better to submit to the government of Gauls
than of Romans, nor ought they to doubt that, if the Romans should overpower
the
Helvetii, they would wrest their freedom from the Aedui together with
the remainder of Gaul. By these very men, [said he], are our plans and
whatever is
done in the camp, disclosed to the enemy; that they could not be restrained
by him: nay more, he was well aware, that though compelled by necessity,
he
had disclosed the matter to Caesar, at how great a risk he had done
it; and for that reason, he had been silent as long as he could."
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.18": [1.18] Caesar perceived that by this
speech of Liscus, Dumnorix, the brother of Divitiacus, was indicated; but,
as he was unwilling that
these matters should be discussed while so many were present, he speedily
dismisses: the council, but detains Liscus: he inquires from him when alone,
about those things which he had said in the meeting. He [Liscus] speaks
more unreservedly and boldly. He [Caesar] makes inquiries on the same points
privately of others, and discovered that it is all true; that "Dumnorix
is the person, a man of the highest daring, in great favor with the people
on account of
his liberality, a man eager for a revolution: that for a great many
years he has been in the habit of contracting for the customs and all the
other taxes of the
Aedui at a small cost, because when he bids, no one dares to bid against
him. By these means he has both increased his own private property, and
amassed great means for giving largesses; that he maintains constantly
at his own expense and keeps about his own person a great number of cavalry,
and
that not only at home, but even among the neighboring states, he has
great influence, and for the sake of strengthening this influence has given
his mother in
marriage among the Bituriges to a man the most noble and most influential
there; that he has himself taken a wife from among the Helvetii, and has
given his
sister by the mother's side and his female relations in marriage into
other states; that he favors and wishes well to the Helvetii on account
of this connection;
and that he hates Caesar and the Romans, on his own account, because
by their arrival his power was weakened, and his brother, Divitiacus, restored
to
his former position of influence and dignity: that, if any thing should
happen to the Romans, he entertains the highest hope of gaining the sovereignty
by
means of the Helvetii, but that under the government of the Roman people
he despairs not only of royalty, but even of that influence which he already
has."
Caesar discovered too, on inquiring into the unsuccessful cavalry engagement
which had taken place a few days before, that the commencement of that
flight had been made by Dumnorix and his cavalry (for Dumnorix was
in command of the cavalry which the Aedui had sent for aid to Caesar);
that by their
flight the rest of the cavalry were dismayed.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.19": [1.19] After learning these circumstances,
since to these suspicions the most unequivocal facts were added, viz.,
that he had led the
Helvetii through the territories of the Sequani; that he had provided
that hostages should be mutually given; that he had done all these things,
not only
without any orders of his [Caesar's] and of his own state's, but even
without their [the Aedui] knowing any thing of it themselves; that he [Dumnorix]
was
reprimanded: by the [chief] magistrate of the Aedui; he [Caesar] considered
that there was sufficient reason, why he should either punish him himself,
or
order the state to do so. One thing [however] stood in the way of all
this-that he had learned by experience his brother Divitiacus's very high
regard for the
Roman people, his great affection toward him, his distinguished faithfulness,
justice, and moderation; for he was afraid lest by the punishment of this
man,
he should hurt the feelings of Divitiacus. Therefore, before he attempted
any thing, he orders Divitiacus to be summoned to him, and, when the ordinary
interpreters had been withdrawn, converses with him through Caius Valerius
Procillus, chief of the province of Gaul, an intimate friend of his, in
whom he
reposed the highest confidence in every thing; at the same time he
reminds him of what was said about Dumnorix in the council of the Gauls,
when he
himself was present, and shows what each had said of him privately
in his [Caesar's] own presence; he begs and exhorts him, that, without
offense to his
feelings, he may either himself pass judgment on him [Dumnorix] after
trying the case, or else order the [Aeduan] state to do so.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.20": [1.20] Divitiacus, embracing Caesar,
begins to implore him, with many tears, that "he would not pass any very
severe sentence upon
his brother; saying, that he knows that those charges are true, and
that nobody suffered more pain on that account than he himself did; for
when he himself
could effect a very great deal by his influence at home and in the
rest of Gaul, and he [Dumnorix] very little on account of his youth, the
latter had become
powerful through his means, which power and strength he used not only
to the lessening of his [Divitiacus] popularity, but almost to his ruin;
that he,
however, was influenced both by fraternal affection and by public opinion.
But if any thing very severe from Caesar should befall him [Dumnorix],
no one
would think that it had been done without his consent, since he himself
held such a place in Caesar's friendship: from which circumstance it would
arise,
that the affections of the whole of Gaul would be estranged from him."
As he was with tears begging these things of Caesar in many words, Caesar
takes
his right hand, and, comforting him, begs him to make an end of entreating,
and assures him that his regard for him is so great, that he forgives both
the
injuries of the republic and his private wrongs, at his desire and
prayers. He summons Dumnorix to him; he brings in his brother; he points
out what he
censures in him; he lays before him what he of himself perceives, and
what the state complains of; he warns him for the future to avoid all grounds
of
suspicion; he says that he pardons the past, for the sake of his brother,
Divitiacus. He sets spies over Dumnorix that he may be able to know what
he
does, and with whom he communicates.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.21": [1.21] Being on the same day informed
by his scouts, that the enemy had encamped at the foot of a mountain eight
miles from his own
camp; he sent persons to ascertain what the nature of the mountain
was, and of what kind the ascent on every side. Word was brought back,
that it was
easy. During the third watch he orders Titus Labienus, his lieutenant
with praetorian powers, to ascend to the highest ridge of the mountain
with two
legions, and with those as guides who had examined the road; he explains
what his plan is. He himself during the fourth watch, hastens to them by
the
same route by which the enemy had gone, and sends on all the cavalry
before him. Publius Considius, who was reputed to be very experienced in
military
affairs, and had been in the army of Lucius Sulla, and afterward in
that of Marcus Crassus, is sent forward with the scouts.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.22": [1.22] At day-break, when the summit
of the mountain was in the possession of Titus Labienus, and he himself
was not further off than
a mile and half from the enemy's camp, nor, as he afterward ascertained
from the captives, had either his arrival or that of Labienus been discovered;
Considius, with his horse at full gallop, comes up to him says that
the mountain which he [Caesar] wished should be seized by Labienus, is
in possession of
the enemy; that he has discovered this by the Gallic arms and ensigns.
Caesar leads off his forces to the next hill: [and] draws them up in battle-order.
Labienus, as he had been ordered by Caesar not to come to an engagement
unless [Caesar's] own forces were seen near the enemy's camp, that the
attack upon the enemy might be made on every side at the same time,
was, after having taken possession of the mountain, waiting for our men,
and
refraining from battle. When, at length, the day was far advanced,
Caesar learned through spies, that the mountain was in possession of his
own men, and
that the Helvetii had moved their camp, and that Considius, struck
with fear, had reported to him, as seen, that which he had not seen. On
that day he
follows the enemy at his usual distance, and pitches his camp three
miles from theirs.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.23": [1.23] The next day (as there remained
in all only two day's space [to the time] when he must serve out the corn
to his army, and as
he was not more than eighteen miles from Bibracte, by far the largest
and best-stored town of the Aedui), he thought that he ought to provide
for a supply
of corn; and diverted his march from the Helvetii, and advanced rapidly
to Bibracte. This circumstance is reported to the enemy by some deserters
from
Lucius Aemilius, a captain, of the Gallic horse. The Helvetii, either
because they thought that the Romans, struck with terror, were retreating
from them,
the more so, as the day before, though they had seized on the higher
grounds, they had not joined battle or because they flattered themselves
that they
might be cut of from the provisions, altering their plan and changing
their route, began to pursue, and to annoy our men in the rear.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.24": [1.24] Caesar, when he observes this,
draws off his forces to the next hill, and sent the cavalry to sustain
the attack of the enemy. He
himself, meanwhile, drew up on the middle of the hill a triple line
of his four veteran legions in such a manner, that he placed above him
on the very summit
the two legions, which he had lately levied in Hither Gaul, and all
the auxiliaries; and he ordered that the whole mountain should be covered
with men, and
that meanwhile the baggage should be brought together into one place,
and the position be protected by those who were posted in the upper line.
The
Helvetii having followed with all their wagons, collected their baggage
into one place: they themselves, after having repulsed our cavalry and
formed a
phalanx, advanced up to our front line in very close order.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.25": [1.25] Caesar, having removed out
of sight first his own horse, then those of all, that he might make the
danger of a11 equal, and do
away with the hope of flight, after encouraging his men, joined battle.
His soldiers hurling their javelins from the higher ground, easily broke
the enemy's
phalanx. That being dispersed, they made a charge on them with drawn
swords. It was a great hinderance to the Gauls in fighting, that, when
several of
their bucklers had been by one stroke of the (Roman) javelins pierced
through and pinned fast together, as the point of the iron had bent itself,
they could
neither pluck it out, nor, with their left hand entangled, fight with
sufficient ease; so that many, after having long tossed their arm about,
chose rather to cast
away the buckler from their hand, and to fight with their person unprotected.
At length, worn out with wounds, they began to give way, and, as there
was
in the neighborhood a mountain about a mile off, to betake themselves
thither. When the mountain had been gained, and our men were advancing
up, the
Boii and Tulingi, who with about 15,000 men closed the enemy's line
of march and served as a guard to their rear, having assailed our men on
the
exposed flank as they advanced [prepared] to surround them; upon seeing
which, the Helvetii who had betaken themselves to the mountain, began to
press on again and renew the battle. The Romans having faced about,
advanced to the attack in two divisions; the first and second line, to
withstand those
who had been defeated and driven off the field; the third to receive
those who were just arriving.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.26": [1.26] Thus, was the contest long
and vigorously carried on with doubtful success. When they could no longer
withstand the attacks of
our men, the one division, as they had begun to do, betook themselves
to the mountain; the other repaired to their baggage and wagons. For during
the
whole of this battle, although the fight lasted from the seventh hour
[i.e. 12 (noon) 1 P. M.] to eventide, no one could see an enemy with his
back turned.
The fight was carried on also at the baggage till late in the night,
for they had set wagons in the way as a rampart, and from the higher ground
kept
throwing weapons upon our men, as they came on, and some from between
the wagons and the wheels kept darting their lances and javelins from
beneath, and wounding our men. After the fight had lasted some time,
our men gained possession of their baggage and camp. There the daughter
and one
of the sons of Orgetorix was taken. After the battle about 130,000
men [of the enemy] remained alive, who marched incessantly during the whole
of that
night; and after a march discontinued for no part of the night, arrived
in the territories of the Lingones on the fourth day, while our men, having
stopped for
three days, both on account of the wounds of the soldiers and the burial
of the slain, had not been able to follow them. Caesar sent letters and
messengers
to the Lingones [with orders] that they should not assist them with
corn or with any thing else; for that if they should assist them, he would
regard them in
the same light as the Helvetii. After the three days' interval he began
to follow them himself with all his forces.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.27": [1.27] The Helvetii, compelled by
the want of every thing, sent embassadors to him about a surrender. When
these had met him on
the way and had thrown themselves at his feet, and speaking in suppliant
tone had with tears sued for peace, and [when] he had ordered them to await
his
arrival, in the place, where they then were, they obeyed his commands.
When Caesar arrived at that place, he demanded hostages, their arms, and
the
slaves who had deserted to them. While those things are being sought
for and got together, after a night's interval, about 6000 men of that
canton which is
called the Verbigene, whether terrified by fear, lest after delivering
up their arms, they should suffer punishment, or else induced by the hope
of safety,
because they supposed that, amid so vast a multitude of those who had
surrendered themselves, their flight might either be concealed or entirely
overlooked, having at night-fall departed out of the camp of the Helvetii,
hastened to the Rhine and the territories of the Germans.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.28": [1.28] But when Caesar discovered
this, he commanded those through whose territory they had gone, to seek
them out and to bring
them back again, if they meant to be acquitted before him; and considered
them, when brought back, in the light of enemies; he admitted all the rest
to a
surrender, upon their delivering up the hostages, arms, and deserters.
He ordered the Helvetii, the Tulingi, and the Latobrigi, to return to their
territories
from which they had come, and as there was at home nothing whereby
they might support their hunger, all the productions of the earth having
been
destroyed, he commanded the Allobroges to let them have a plentiful
supply of corn; and ordered them to rebuild the towns and villages which
they had
burned. This he did, chiefly, on this account, because he was unwilling
that the country, from which the Helvetii had departed, should be untenanted,
lest
the Germans, who dwell on the other side of the Rhine, should, on account
of the excellence of the lands, cross over from their own territories into
those
of the Helvetii, and become borderers upon the province of Gaul and
the Allobroges. He granted the petition of the Aedui, that they might settle
the Boii,
in their own (i. e. in the Aeduan) territories, as these were known
to be of distinguished valor, to whom they gave lands, and whom they afterward
admitted to the same state of rights and freedom as themselves.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.29": [1.29] In the camp of the Helvetii,
lists were found, drawn up in Greek characters, and were brought to Caesar,
in which an estimate
had been drawn up, name by name, of the number which had gone forth
from their country of those who were able to bear arms; and likewise the
boys,
the old men, and the women, separately. Of all which items the total
was:
 Of the Helvetii [lit. of the heads of the Helvetii] 263,000
 Of the Tulingi . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . 36,000
 Of the Latobrigi .-. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . .14,000
 Of the Rauraci . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . .23,000
 Of the Boii . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . 32,000
 The sum of all amounted to . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 368,000
<p align="justify">Out of these, such as could bear arms, [amounted] to about 92,000. When
the census of those who returned home was taken, as Caesar had
commanded, the number was found to be 110,000.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.30": [1.30] When the war with the Helvetii
was concluded, embassadors from almost all parts of Gaul, the chiefs of
states, assembled to
congratulate Caesar, [saying] that they were well aware, that, although
he had taken vengeance on the Helvetii in war, for the old wrong done by
them to
the Roman people, yet that circumstance had happened no less to the
benefit of the land of Gaul than of the Roman people, because the Helvetii,
while
their affairs were most flourishing, had quitted their country with
the design of making war upon the whole of Gaul, and seizing the government
of it, and
selecting, out of a great abundance, that spot for an abode, which
they should judge to be the most convenient and most productive of all
Gaul, and hold
the rest of the states as tributaries. They requested that they might
be allowed to proclaim an assembly of the whole of Gaul for a particular
day, and to do
that with Caesar's permission, [stating] that they had some things
which, with the general consent, they wished to ask of him. This request
having been
granted, they appointed a day for the assembly, and ordained by an
oath with each other, that no one should disclose [their deliberations]
except those to
whom this [office] should be assigned by the general assembly.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.31": [1.31] When that assembly was dismissed,
the same chiefs of states, who had before been to Caesar, returned, and
asked that they
might be allowed to treat with him privately (in secret) concerning
the safety of themselves and of all. That request having been obtained,
they all threw
themselves in tears at Caesar's feet, [saying] that they no less begged
and earnestly desired that what they might say should not be disclosed,
than that they
might obtain those things which they wished for; inasmuch as they saw,
that, if a disclosure was made, they should be put to the greatest tortures.
For
these Divitiacus the Aeduan spoke and told him: "That there were two
parties in the whole of Gaul: that the Aedui stood at the head of one of
these, the
Arverni of the other. After these had been violently struggling with
one another for the superiority for many years, it came to pass that the
Germans were
called in for hire by the Arverni and the Sequani. That about 15,000
of them [i.e. of the Germans] had at first crossed the Rhine: but after
that these wild
and savage men had become enamored of the lands and the refinement
and the abundance of the Gauls, more were brought over, that there were
now as
many as 120,000 of them in Gaul: that with these the Aedui and their
dependents had repeatedly struggled in arms-that they had been routed,
and had
sustained a great calamity-had lost all their nobility, all their senate,
all their cavalry. And that broken by such engagements and calamities,
although they
had formerly been very powerful in Gaul, both from their own valor
and from the Roman people's hospitality and friendship, they were now compelled
to
give the chief nobles of their state, as hostages to the Sequani, and
to bind their state by an oath, that they would neither demand hostages
in return, nor
supplicate aid from the Roman people, nor refuse to be forever under
their sway and empire. That he was the only one out of all the state of
the Aedui,
who could not be prevailed upon to take the oath or to give his children
as hostages. On that account he had fled from his state and had gone to
the senate
at Rome to beseech aid, as he alone was bound neither by oath nor hostages.
But a worse thing had befallen the victorious Sequani than the vanquished
Aedui, for Ariovistus the king of the Germans, had settled in their
territories, and had seized upon a third of their land, which was the best
in the whole of
Gaul, and was now ordering them to depart from another third part,
because a few months previously 24,000 men of the Harudes had come to him,
for
whom room and settlements must be provided. The consequence would be,
that in a few years they would all be driven from the territories of Gaul,
and
all the Germans would cross the Rhine; for neither must the land of
Gaul be compared with the land of the Germans, nor must the habit of living
of the
latter be put on a level with that of the former. Moreover, [as for]
Ariovistus, no sooner did he defeat the forces of the Gauls in a battle
which took place
at Magetobria, than [he began] to lord it haughtily and cruelly, to
demand as hostages the children of all the principal nobles, and wreak
on them every
kind of cruelty, if every thing was not done at his nod or pleasure;
that he was a savage, passionate, and reckless man, and that his commands
could no
longer be borne. Unless there was some aid in Caesar and the Roman
people, the Gauls must all do the same thing that the Helvetii have done,
[viz.]
emigrate from their country, and seek another dwelling place, other
settlements remote from the Germans, and try whatever fortune may fall
to their lot. If
these things were to be disclosed to Ariovistus, [Divitiacus adds]
that he doubts not that he would inflict the most severe punishment on
all the hostages
who are in his possession, [and says] that Caesar could, either by
his own influence and by that of his army, or by his late victory, or by
name of the
Roman people, intimidate him, so as to prevent a greater number of
Germans being brought over the Rhine, and could protect all Gaul from the
outrages
of Ariovistus.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.32": [1.32] When this speech had been
delivered by Divitiacus, all who were present began with loud lamentation
to entreat assistance of
Caesar. Caesar noticed that the Sequani were the only people of all
who did none of those things which the others did, but, with their heads
bowed down,
gazed on the earth in sadness. Wondering what was the reason of this
conduct, he inquired of themselves. No reply did the Sequani make, but
silently
continued in the same sadness. When he had repeatedly inquired of them
and could not elicit any answer at all, the same Divitiacus the Aeduan
answered,
that-"the lot of the Sequani was more wretched and grievous than that
of the rest, on this account, because they alone durst not even in secret
complain or
supplicate aid; and shuddered at the cruelty of Ariovistus [even when]
absent, just as if he were present; for, to the rest, despite of every
thing there was
an opportunity of flight given; but all tortures must be endured by
the Sequani, who had admitted Ariovistus within their territories, and
whose towns were
all in his power."
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.33": [1.33] Caesar, on being informed
of these things, cheered the minds of the Gauls with his words, and promised
that this affair should
be an object of his concern, [saying] that he had great hopes that
Ariovistus, induced both by his kindness and his power, would put an end
to his
oppression. After delivering this speech, he dismissed the assembly;
and, besides those statements, many circumstances induced him to think
that this affair
ought to be considered and taken up by him; especially as he saw that
the Aedui, styled [as they had been] repeatedly by the senate "brethren"
and
"kinsmen," were held in the thraldom and dominion of the Germans, and
understood that their hostages were with Ariovistus and the Sequani, which
in so
mighty an empire [as that] of the Roman people he considered very disgraceful
to himself and the republic. That, moreover, the Germans should by
degrees become accustomed to cross the Rhine, and that a great body
of them should come into Gaul, he saw [would be] dangerous to the Roman
people, and judged, that wild and savage men would not be likely to
restrain themselves, after they had possessed themselves of all Gaul, from
going forth
into the province and thence marching into Italy (as the Cimbri and
Teutones had done before them), particularly as the Rhone [was the sole
barrier that]
separated the Sequani from our province. Against which events he thought
he ought to provide as speedily as possible. Moreover, Ariovistus, for
his part,
had assumed to himself such pride and arrogance, that he was felt to
be quite insufferable.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.34": [1.34] He therefore determined to
send embassadors to Ariovistus to demand of him to name some intermediate
spot for a
conference between the two, [saying] that he wished to treat him on
state-business and matters of the highest importance to both of them. To
this embassy
Ariovistus replied, that if he himself had had need of any thing from
Caesar, he would have gone to him; and that if Caesar wanted any thing
from him he
ought to come to him. That, besides, neither dare he go without an
army into those parts of Gaul which Caesar had possession of, nor could
he, without
great expense and trouble, draw his army together to one place; that
to him, moreover, it appeared strange, what business either Caesar or the
Roman
people at all had in his own Gaul, which he had conquered in war.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.35": [1.35] When these answers were reported
to Caesar, he sends embassadors to him a second time with this message.
"Since, after
having been treated with so much kindness by himself and the Roman
people (as he had in his consulship been styled 'king and friend' by the
senate), he
makes this recompense to [Caesar] himself and the Roman people, [viz.]
that when invited to a conference he demurs, and does not think that it
concerns
him to advise and inform himself about an object of mutual interest,
these are the things which he requires of him; first, that he do not any
more bring over
any body of men across the Rhine into Gaul; in the next place, that
he restore the hostages, which he has from the Aedui, and grant the Sequani
permission
to restore to them with his consent those hostages which they have,
and that he neither provoke the Aedui by outrage nor make war upon them
or their
allies; if he would accordingly do this," [Caesar says] that "he himself
and the Roman people will entertain a perpetual feeling of favor and friendship
toward him; but that if he [Caesar] does not obtain [his desires] that
he (forasmuch as in the consulship of Marcus Messala and Marcus Piso the
senate
had decreed that, whoever should have the administration of the province
of Gaul should, as far as he could do so consistently with the interests
of the
republic, protect the Aedui and the other friends of the Roman people),
will not overlook the wrongs of the Aedui."
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.36": [1.36] To this Ariovistus replied,
that "the right of war was, that they who had conquered should govern those
whom they had
conquered, in what manner they pleased; that in that way the Roman
people were wont to govern the nations which they had conquered, not according
to
the dictation of any other, but according to their own discretion.
If he for his part did not dictate to the Roman people as to the manner
in which they were
to exercise their right, he ought not to be obstructed by the Roman
people in his right; that the Aedui, inasmuch as they had tried the fortune
of war and
had engaged in arms and been conquered, had become tributaries to him;
that Caesar was doing a great injustice, in that by his arrival he was
making his
revenues less valuable to him; that he should not restore their hostages
to the Aedui, but should not make war wrongfully either upon them or their
allies, if
they abided by that which had been agreed on, and paid their tribute
annually: if they did not continue to do that, the Roman people's name
of 'brothers'
would avail them naught. As to Caesar's threatening him, that he would
not overlook the wrongs of the Aedui, [he said] that no one had ever entered
into
a contest with him [Ariovistus] without utter ruin to himself. That
Caesar might enter the lists when he chose; he would feel what the invincible
Germans,
well-trained [as they were] beyond all others to arms, who for fourteen
years had not been beneath a roof, could achieve by their valor."
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.37": [1.37] At the same time that this
message was delivered to Caesar, embassadors came from the Aedui and the
Treviri; from the Aedui
to complain that the Harudes, who had lately been brought over into
Gaul, were ravaging their territories; that they had not been able to purchase
peace
from Ariovistus, even by giving hostages: and from the Treviri, [to
state] that a hundred cantons of the Suevi had encamped on the banks of
the Rhine, and
were attempting to cross it; that the brothers, Nasuas and Cimberius,
headed them. Being greatly alarmed at these things, Caesar thought that
he ought to
use all dispatch, lest, if this new band of Suevi should unite with
the old troops of Ariovistus, he [Ariovistus] might be less easily withstood.
Having
therefore, as quickly as he could, provided a supply of corn, he hastened
to Ariovistus by forced marches.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.38": [1.38] When he had proceeded three
days' journey, word was brought to him that Ariovistus was hastening with
all his forces to seize
on Vesontio, which is the largest town of the Sequani, and had advanced
three days' journey from its territories. Caesar thought that he ought
to take the
greatest precautions lest this should happen, for there was in that
town a most ample supply of every thing which was serviceable for war;
and so fortified
was it by the nature of the ground, as to afford a great facility for
protracting the war, inasmuch as the river Doubs almost surrounds the whole
town, as
though it were traced round it with a pair of compasses. A mountain
of great height shuts in the remaining space, which is not more than 600
feet, where
the river leaves a gap, in such a manner that the roots of that mountain
extend to the river's bank on either side. A wall thrown around it makes
a citadel of
this [mountain], and connects it with the town. Hither Caesar hastens
by forced marches by night and day, and, after having seized the town,
stations a
garrison there.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.39": [1.39] While he is tarrying a few
days at Vesontio, on account of corn and provisions; from the inquiries
of our men and the reports of
the Gauls and traders (who asserted that the Germans were men of huge
stature, of incredible valor and practice in arms-that oftentimes they,
on
encountering them, could not bear even their countenance, and the fierceness
of their eyes)-so great a panic on a sudden seized the whole army, as to
discompose the minds and spirits of all in no slight degree. This first
arose from the tribunes of the soldiers, the prefects and the rest, who,
having followed
Caesar from the city [Rome] from motives of friendship, had no great
experience in military affairs. And alleging, some of them one reason,
some another,
which they said made it necessary for them to depart, they requested
that by his consent they might be allowed to withdraw; some, influenced
by shame,
stayed behind in order that they might avoid the suspicion of cowardice.
These could neither compose their countenance, nor even sometimes check
their
tears: but hidden in their tents, either bewailed their fate, or deplored
with their comrades the general danger. Wills were sealed universally throughout
the
whole camp. By the expressions and cowardice of these men, even those
who possessed great experience in the camp, both soldiers and centurions,
and
those [the decurions] who were in command of the cavalry, were gradually
disconcerted. Such of them as wished to be considered less alarmed, said
that
they did not dread the enemy, but feared the narrowness of the roads
and the vastness of the forests which lay between them and Ariovistus,
or else that
the supplies could not be brought up readily enough. Some even declared
to Caesar, that when he gave orders for the camp to be moved and the troops
to advance, the soldiers would not be obedient to the command, nor
advance in consequence of their fear.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.40": [1.40] When Caesar observed these
things, having called a council, and summoned to it the centurions of all
the companies, he
severely reprimanded them, "particularly, for supposing that it belonged
to them to inquire or conjecture, either in what direction they were marching,
or
with what object. That Ariovistus, during his [Caesar's] consulship,
had most anxiously sought after the friendship of the Roman people; why
should any
one judge that he would so rashly depart from his duty? He for his
part was persuaded, that, when his demands were known and the fairness
of the terms
considered, he would reject neither his nor the Roman people's favor.
But even if, driven on by rage and madness, he should make war upon them,
what
after all were they afraid of?-or why should they despair either of
their own valor or of his zeal? Of that enemy a trial had been made within
our fathers'
recollection, when, on the defeat of the Cimbri and Teutones by Caius
Marius, the army was regarded as having deserved no less praise than their
commander himself. It had been made lately, too, in Italy, during the
rebellion of the slaves, whom, however, the experience and training which
they had
received from us, assisted in some respect. From which a judgment might
be formed of the advantages which resolution carries with it inasmuch as
those
whom for some time they had groundlessly dreaded when unarmed, they
had afterward vanquished, when well armed and flushed with success. In
short,
that these were the same men whom the Helvetii, in frequent encounters,
not only in their own territories, but also in theirs [the German], have
generally
vanquished, and yet can not have been a match for our army. If the
unsuccessful battle and flight of the Gauls disquieted any, these, if they
made inquiries,
might discover that, when the Gauls had been tired out by the long
duration of the war, Ariovistus, after he had many months kept himself
in his camp and
in the marshes, and had given no opportunity for an engagement, fell
suddenly upon them, by this time despairing of a battle and scattered in
all directions,
and was victorious more through stratagem and cunning than valor. But
though there had been room for such stratagem against savage and unskilled
men,
not even [Ariovistus] himself expected that thereby our armies could
be entrapped. That those who ascribed their fear to a pretense about the
[deficiency
of] supplies and the narrowness of the roads, acted presumptuously,
as they seemed either to distrust their general's discharge of his duty,
or to dictate to
him. That these things were his concern; that the Sequani, the Leuci,
and the Lingones were to furnish the corn; and that it was already ripe
in the fields;
that as to the road they would soon be able to judge for themselves.
As to its being reported that the soldiers would not be obedient to command,
or
advance, he was not at all disturbed at that; for he knew, that in
the case of all those whose army had not been obedient to command, either
upon some
mismanagement of an affair, fortune had deserted them, or, that upon
some crime being discovered, covetousness had been clearly proved [against
them].
His integrity had been seen throughout his whole life, his good fortune
in the war with the Helvetii. That he would therefore instantly set about
what he had
intended to put off till a more distant day, and would break up his
camp the next night, in the fourth watch, that he might ascertain, as soon
as possible,
whether a sense of honor and duty, or whether fear had more influence
with them. But that, if no one else should follow, yet he would go with
only the
tenth legion, of which he had no misgivings, and it should be his praetorian
cohort." This legion Caesar had both greatly favored, and in it, on account
of its
valor, placed the greatest confidence.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.41": [1.41] Upon the delivery of this
speech, the minds of all were changed in a surprising manner, and the highest
ardor and eagerness for
prosecuting the war were engendered; and the tenth legion was the first
to return thanks to him, through their military tribunes, for his having
expressed this
most favorable opinion of them; and assured him that they were quite
ready to prosecute the war. Then, the other legions endeavored, through
their
military tribunes and the centurions of the principal companies, to
excuse themselves to Caesar, [saying] that they had never either doubted
or feared, or
supposed that the determination of the conduct of the war was theirs
and not their general's. Having accepted their excuse, and having had the
road
carefully reconnoitered by Divitiacus, because in him of all others
he had the greatest faith [he found] that by a circuitous route of more
than fifty miles he
might lead his army through open parts; he then set out in the fourth
watch, as he had said [he would]. On the seventh day, as he did not discontinue
his
march, he was informed by scouts that the forces of Ariovistus were
only four and twenty miles distant from ours.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.42": [1.42] Upon being apprized of Caesar's
arrival, Ariovistus sends embassadors to him, [saying] that what he had
before requested as
to a conference, might now, as far as his permission went, take place,
since he [Caesar] had approached nearer, and he considered that he might
now do
it without danger. Caesar did not reject the proposal and began to
think that he was now returning to a rational state of mind as he spontaneously
proffered that which he had previously refused to him when requesting
it; and was in great hopes that, in consideration of his own and the Roman
people's
great favors toward him, the issue would be that he would desist from
his obstinacy upon his demands being made known. The fifth day after that
was
appointed as the day of conference. Meanwhile, as ambassadors were
being often sent to and fro between them, Ariovistus demanded that Caesar
should
not bring any foot-soldier with him to the conference, [saying] that
"he was afraid of being ensnared by him through treachery; that both should
come
accompanied by cavalry; that he would not come on any other condition."
Caesar, as he neither wished that the conference should, by an excuse thrown
in the way, be set aside, nor durst trust his life to the cavalry of
the Gauls, decided that it would be most expedient to take away from the
Gallic cavalry all
their horses, and thereon to mount the legionary soldiers of the tenth
legion, in which he placed the greatest confidence, in order that he might
have a
body-guard as trustworthy as possible, should there be any need for
action. And when this was done, one of the soldiers of the tenth legion
said, not
without a touch of humor, "that Caesar did more for them than he had
promised; he had promised to have the tenth legion in place of his praetorian
cohort; but he now converted them into horse."
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.43": [1.43] There was a large plain, and
in it a mound of earth of considerable size. This spot was at nearly an
equal distance from both
camps. Thither, as had been appointed, they came for the conference.
Caesar stationed the legion, which he had brought [with him] on horseback,
200
paces from this mound. The cavalry of Ariovistus also took their stand
at an equal distance. Ariovistus then demanded that they should confer
on
horseback, and that, besides themselves, they should bring with them
ten men each to the conference. When they were come to the place, Caesar,
in the
opening of his speech, detailed his own and the senate's favors toward
him [Ariovistus], in that he had been styled king, in that [he had been
styled] friend,
by the senate-in that very considerable presents had been sent him;
which circumstance he informed him had both fallen to the lot of few, and
had usually
been bestowed in consideration of important personal services; that
he, although he had neither an introduction, nor a just ground for the
request, had
obtained these honors through the kindness and munificence of himself
[Caesar] and the senate. He informed him too, how old and how just were
the
grounds of connection that existed between themselves [the Romans]
and the Aedui, what decrees of the senate had been passed in their favor,
and how
frequent and how honorable; how from time immemorial the Aedui had
held the supremacy of the whole of Gaul; even [said Caesar] before they
had
sought our friendship; that it was the custom of the Roman people to
desire not only that its allies and friends should lose none of their property,
but be
advanced in influence, dignity, and honor: who then could endure that
what they had brought with them to the friendship of the Roman people should
be
torn from them?" He then made the same demands which he had commissioned
the embassadors to make, that [Ariovistus] should not make war either
upon the Aedui or their allies, that he should restore the hostages;
that if he could not send back to their country any part of the Germans,
he should at all
events suffer none of them any more to cross the Rhine.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.44": [1.44] Ariovistus briefly replied
to the demands of Caesar; but expatiated largely on his own virtues, "that
he had crossed the Rhine
not of his own accord, but on being invited and sent for by the Gauls;
that he had not left home and kindred without great expectations and great
rewards;
that he had settlements in Gaul, granted by the Gauls themselves; that
the hostages had been given by their good-will; that he took by right of
war the
tribute which conquerors are accustomed to impose on the conquered;
that he had not made war upon the Gauls, but the Gauls upon him; that all
the
states of Gaul came to attack him, and had encamped against him; that
all their forces had been routed and beaten by him in a single battle;
that if they
chose to make a second trial, he was ready to encounter them again;
but if they chose to enjoy peace, it was unfair to refuse the tribute,
which of their
own free-will they had paid up to that time. That the friendship of
the Roman people ought to prove to him an ornament and a safeguard, not
a detriment;
and that he sought it with that expectation. But if through the Roman
people the tribute was to be discontinued, and those who surrendered to
be seduced
from him, he would renounce the friendship of the Roman people no less
heartily than he had sought it. As to his leading over a host of Germans
into Gaul,
that he was doing this with a view of securing himself, not of assaulting
Gaul: that there was evidence of this, in that he did not come without
being invited,
and in that he did not make war, but merely warded it off. That he
had come into Gaul before the Roman people. That never before this time
did a Roman
army go beyond the frontiers of the province of Gaul. What [said he]
does [Caesar] desire?- why come into his [Ariovistus] domains?-that this
was his
province of Gaul, just as that is ours. As it ought not to be pardoned
in him, if he were to make an attack upon our territories; so, likewise,
that we were
unjust, to obstruct him in his prerogative. As for Caesar's saying
that the Aedui had been styled 'brethren' by the senate, he was not so
uncivilized nor so
ignorant of affairs, as not to know that the Aedui in the very last
war with the Allobroges had neither rendered assistance to the Romans,
nor received any
from the Roman people in the struggles which the Aedui had been maintaining
with him and with the Sequani. He must feel suspicious, that Caesar, though
feigning friendship as the reason for his keeping an army in Gaul,
was keeping it with the view of crushing him. And that unless he depart
and withdraw his
army from these parts, he shall regard him not as a friend, but as
a foe; and that, even if he should put him to death, he should do what
would please many
of the nobles and leading men of the Roman people; he had assurance
of that from themselves through their messengers, and could purchase the
favor and
the friendship of them all by his [Caesar's] death. But if he would
depart and resign to him the free possession of Gaul, he would recompense
him with a
great reward, and would bring to a close whatever wars he wished to
be carried on, without any trouble or risk to him."
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.45": [1.45] Many things were stated by
Caesar to the effect [to show]; "why he could not waive the business, and
that neither his nor the
Roman people's practice would suffer him to abandon most meritorious
allies, nor did he deem that Gaul belonged to Ariovistus rather than to
the Roman
people; that the Arverni and the Ruteni had been subdued in war by
Quintus Fabius Maximus, and that the Roman people had pardoned them and
had
not reduced them into a province or imposed a tribute upon them. And
if the most ancient period was to be regarded-then was the sovereignty
of the
Roman people in Gaul most just: if the decree of the Senate was to
be observed, then ought Gaul to be free, which they [the Romans] had conquered
in
war, and had permitted to enjoy its own laws."
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.46": [1.46] While these things are being
transacted in the conference it was announced to Caesar that the cavalry
of Ariovistus were
approaching nearer the mound, and were riding up to our men, and casting
stones and weapons at them. Caesar made an end of his speech and betook
himself to his men; and commanded them that they should by no means
return a weapon upon the enemy. For though he saw that an engagement with
the
cavalry would be without any danger to his chosen legion, yet he did
not think proper to engage, lest, after the enemy were routed, it might
be said that
they had been insnared by him under the sanction of a conference. When
it was spread abroad among the common soldiery with what haughtiness
Ariovistus had behaved at the conference, and how he had ordered the
Romans to quit Gaul, and how his cavalry had made an attack upon our men,
and
how this had broken off the conference, a much greater alacrity and
eagerness for battle was infused into our army.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.47": [1.47] Two days after, Ariovistus
sends embassadors to Caesar, to state "that he wished to treat with him
about those things which
had been begun to be treated of between them, but had not been concluded;"
[and to beg] that "he would either again appoint a day for a conference;
or,
if he were not willing to do that, that he would send one of his [officers]
as an embassador to him." There did not appear to Caesar any good reason
for
holding a conference; and the more so as the day before the Germans
could not be restrained from casting weapons at our men. He thought he
should not
without great danger send to him as embassador one of his [Roman] officers,
and should expose him to savage men. It seemed [therefore] most proper
to
send to him C. Valerius Procillus, the son of C. Valerius Caburus,
a young man of the highest courage and accomplishments (whose father had
been
presented with the freedom of the city by C. Valerius Flaccus), both
on account of his fidelity and on account of his knowledge of the Gallic
language,
which Ariovistus, by long practice, now spoke fluently; and because
in his case the Germans would have no motive for committing violence; and
[as his
colleague] M. Mettius, who had shared the hospitality of Ariovistus.
He commissioned them to learn what Ariovistus had to say, and to report
to him. But
when Ariovistus saw them before him in his camp, he cried out in the
presence of his army, "Why were they come to him? Was it for the purpose
of acting
as spies?" He stopped them when attempting to speak, and cast them
into chains.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.48": [1.48] The same day he moved his
camp forward and pitched under a hill six miles from Caesar's camp. The
day following he led his
forces past Caesar's camp, and encamped two miles beyond him; with
this design that he might cut off Caesar from the corn and provisions,
which might
be conveyed to him from the Sequani and the Aedui. For five successive
days from that day, Caesar drew out his forces before the camp, and put
them in
battle order, that, if Ariovistus should be willing to engage in battle,
an opportunity might not be wanting to him. Ariovistus all this time kept
his army in
camp: but engaged daily in cavalry skirmishes. The method of battle
in which the Germans had practiced themselves was this. There were 6,000
horse,
and as many very active and courageous foot, one of whom each of the
horse selected out of the whole army for his own protection. By these [foot]
they
were constantly accompanied in their engagements; to these the horse
retired; these on any emergency rushed forward; if any one, upon receiving
a very
severe wound, had fallen from his horse, they stood around him: if
it was necessary to advance further than usual, or to retreat more rapidly,
so great, from
practice, was their swiftness, that, supported by the manes of the
horses, they could keep pace with their speed.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.49": [1.49] Perceiving that Ariovistus
kept himself in camp, Caesar, that he might not any longer be cut off from
provisions, chose a
convenient position for a camp beyond that place in which the Germans
had encamped, at about 600 paces from them, and having drawn up his army
in
three lines, marched to that place. He ordered the first and second
lines to be under arms; the third to fortify the camp. This place was distant
from the
enemy about 600 paces, as has been stated. Thither Ariovistus sent
light troops, about 16,000 men in number, with all his cavalry; which forces
were to
intimidate our men, and hinder them in their fortification. Caesar
nevertheless, as he had before arranged, ordered two lines to drive off
the enemy: the
third to execute the work. The camp being fortified, he left there
two legions and a portion of the auxiliaries; and led back the other four
legions into the
larger camp.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.50": [1.50] The next day, according to
his custom, Caesar led out his forces from both camps, and having advanced
a little from the larger
one, drew up his line of battle, and gave the enemy an opportunity
of fighting. When he found that they did not even then come out [from their
intrenchments,] he led back his army into camp about noon. Then at
last Ariovistus sent part of his forces to attack the lesser camp. The
battle was
vigorously maintained on both sides till the evening. At sunset, after
many wounds had been inflicted and received, Ariovistus led back his forces
into
camp. When Caesar inquired of his prisoners, wherefore Ariovistus did
not come to an engagement, he discovered this to be the reason-that among
the
Germans it was the custom for their matrons to pronounce from lots
and divination, whether it were expedient that the battle should be engaged
in or not;
that they had said, "that it was not the will of heaven that the Germans
should conquer, if they engaged in battle before the new moon."
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.51": [1.51] The day following, Caesar
left what seemed sufficient as a guard for both camps; [and then] drew
up all the auxiliaries in sight
of the enemy, before the lesser camp, because he was not very powerful
in the number of legionary soldiers, considering the number of the enemy;
that
[thereby] he might make use of his auxiliaries for appearance. He himself,
having drawn up his army in three lines, advanced to the camp of the enemy.
Then at last of necessity the Germans drew their forces out of camp,
and disposed them canton by canton, at equal distances, the Harudes, Marcomanni,
Tribocci, Vangiones, Nemetes, Sedusii, Suevi; and surrounded their
whole army with their chariots and wagons, that no hope might be left in
flight. On
these they placed their women, who, with disheveled hair and in tears,
entreated the soldiers, as they went forward to battle, not to deliver
them into
slavery to the Romans.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.52": [1.52] Caesar appointed over each
legion a lieutenant and a questor, that every one might have them as witnesses
of his valor. He
himself began the battle at the head of the right wing, because he
had observed that part of the enemy to be the least strong. Accordingly
our men, upon
the signal being given, vigorously made an attack upon the enemy, and
the enemy so suddenly and rapidly rushed forward, that there was no time
for
casting the javelins at them. Throwing aside [therefore] their javelins,
they fought with swords hand to hand. But the Germans, according to their
custom,
rapidly forming a phalanx, sustained the attack of our swords. There
were found very many of our soldiers who leaped upon the phalanx, and with
their
hands tore away the shields, and wounded the enemy from above. Although
the army of the enemy was routed on the left wing and put to flight, they
[still]
pressed heavily on our men from the right wing, by the great number
of their troops. On observing which, P. Crassus, a young man, who commanded
the
cavalry-as he was more disengaged than those who were employed in the
fight-sent the third line as a relief to our men who were in distress.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.53": [1.53] Thereupon the engagement was
renewed, and all the enemy turned their backs, nor did they cease to flee
until they arrived at
the river Rhine, about fifty miles from that place. There some few,
either relying on their strength, endeavored to swim over, or, finding
boats, procured
their safety. Among the latter was Ariovistus, who meeting with a small
vessel tied to the bank, escaped in it; our horse pursued and slew all
the rest of
them. Ariovistus had two wives, one a Suevan by nation, whom he brought
with him from home; the other a Norican, the sister of king Vocion, whom
he
had married in Gaul, she having been sent [thither for that purpose]
by her brother. Both perished in that flight. Of their two daughters, one
was slain, the
other captured. C. Valerius Procillus, as he was being dragged by his
guards in the fight, bound with a triple chain, fell into the hands of
Caesar himself, as
he was pursuing the enemy with his cavalry. This circumstance indeed
afforded Caesar no less pleasure than the victory itself; because he saw
a man of
the first rank in the province of Gaul, his intimate acquaintance and
friend, rescued from the hand of the enemy, and restored to him, and that
fortune had
not diminished aught of the joy and exultation [of that day] by his
destruction. He [Procillus] said that, in his own presence, the lots had
been thrice
consulted respecting him, whether he should immediately be put to death
by fire, or be reserved for another time: that by the favor of the lots
he was
uninjured. M. Mettius, also, was found and brought back to him [Caesar.]
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.1.54": [1.54] This battle having been reported
beyond the Rhine, the Suevi, who had come to the banks of that river, began
to return home,
when the Ubii, who dwelt nearest to the Rhine, pursuing them, while
much alarmed, slew a great number of them. Caesar having concluded two
very
important wars in one campaign, conducted his army into winter quarters
among the Sequani, a little earlier than the season of the year required.
He
appointed Labienus over the winter-quarters, and set out in person
for Hither Gaul to hold the assizes.
