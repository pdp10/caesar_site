<p align="justify">50 B.C.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.0": [1.0] Vossius's supplement
to the first book: I will now say nothing concerning the absurd opinion
of those who assert that the following Commentaries on the Civil War were
not written by Caesar himself. Even without the authority of Suetonius,
the diction itself would be sufficient to convince the most skeptical that
Caesar and no other was the author. I am of the opinion of those who think
that the beginning of these Commentaries is lost. For I can not be convinced
that Caesar commenced so abruptly; and History itself gives sufficient
evidence that many circumstances require to be previously stated. For which
reason we thought that it would be well worth our attention to compile
from Plutarch, Appian, and Dion, a narrative of such facts as seemed necessary
to fill up the chasm; these facts are as follows: "When Caesar, after reducing
all Transalpine Gaul, had passed into Cisalpine Gaul, he determined for
many reasons to send embassadors to Rome to request for him the consulate,
and a prolongation of the command of his province. Pompey, who was estranged
from Caesar, although he was not as yet at open enmity with him, determined
neither to aid him by his influence nor openly oppose him on this occasion.
But the consuls Lentulus and Marcellus, who had previously been on unfriendly
terms with Caesar, resolved to use all means in their power to prevent
him from gaining his object. Marcellus in particular did not hesitate to
offer Caesar other insults. Caesar had lately planned the colony of Novumcomum
in Gaul: Marcellus, not content with taking from it the right of citizenship,
ordered the principal man of the colony to be arrested and scourged at
Rome, and sent him to make his complaints to Caesar: an insult of this
description had never before been offered to a Roman citizen. While these
transactions are taking place, Caius Curio, tribune of the commons, comes
to Caesar in his province. Curio had made many and energetic struggles,
in behalf of the republic and Caesar's cause: at length when he perceived
that all his efforts were vain, he fled through fear of his adversaries,
and informed Caesar of all the transactions that had taken place, and of
the efforts made by his enemies to crush him. Caesar received Curio with
great kindness, as he was a man of the highest rank, and had great claims
on himself and the republic, and thanked him warmly for his numerous personal
favors. But Curio, as war was being openly prepared against Caesar, advised
him to concentrate his troops, and rescue the republic now oppressed by
a few daring men. Caesar, although he was not ignorant of the real state
of affairs, was however of opinion that particular regard should be paid
to the tranquillity of the republic, lest any one should suppose that he
was the originator of the war. Therefore, through his friends, he made
this one request, that two legions, and the province of Cisalpine Gaul,
and Illyricum, should be left him. All these acts were performed by Caesar,
with the hope that his enemies might be induced by the justice of his demands,
to preserve the peace of the republic. Even Pompey himself did not dare
to oppose them. But when Caesar could not obtain his request from the consuls,
he wrote to the senate a letter, in which he briefly stated his exploits
and public services, and entreated that he should not be deprived of the
favor of the people, who had ordered, that he, although absent, should
be considered a candidate at the next elections; and he stated also that
he would disband his army, if the senate and people of Rome would pass
a resolution to that effect, provided that Pompey would do the same. That,
as long as the latter should retain the command of his army, no just reason
could exist that he [Caesar] should disband his troops and expose himself
to the insults of his enemies. He intrusts this letter to Curio to bear
to its destination; the latter traveled one hundred and sixty miles with
incredible dispatch, and reached the city in three days' time, before the
beginning of January, and before the consuls could pass any decree concerning
Caesar's command. Curio, after accomplishing his journey, kept the letter,
and did not give it up, until there was a crowded meeting of the senate,
and the tribunes of the commons were present; for he was afraid, lest,
if he gave it up previously, the consuls should suppress it.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.1": [1.1] When Caesar's letter
was delivered to the consuls, they were with great difficulty, and a hard
struggle of the tribunes, prevailed on to suffer it to be read in the senate;
but the tribunes could not prevail, that any question should be put to
the senate on the subject of the letter. The consuls put the question on
the regulation of the state. Lucius Lentulus the consul promises that he
will not fail the senate and republic, "if they declared their sentiments
boldly and resolutely, but if they turned their regard to Caesar, and courted
his favor, as they did on former occasions, he would adopt a plan for himself,
and not submit to the authority of the senate: that he too had a means
of regaining Caesar's favor and friendship." Scipio spoke to the same purport,
"that it was Pompey's intention not to abandon the republic, if the senate
would support him; but if they should hesitate and act without energy,
they would in vain implore his aid, if they should require it hereafter."
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.2": [1.2] This speech of Scipio's,
as the senate was convened in the city, and Pompey was near at hand, seemed
to have fallen from the lips of Pompey himself. Some delivered their sentiments
with more moderation, as Marcellus first, who in the beginning of his speech,
said, "that the question ought not to be put to the senate on this matter,
till levies were made throughout all Italy, and armies raised under whose
protection the senate might freely and safely pass such resolutions as
they thought proper;" as Marcus Calidius afterward, who was of opinion,
"that Pompey should set out for his province, that there might be no cause
for arms; that Caesar was naturally apprehensive as two legions were forced
from him, that Pompey was retaining those troops, and keeping them near
the city to do him injury:" as Marcus Rufus, who followed Calidius almost
word for word. They were all harshly rebuked by Lentulus, who peremptorily
refused to propose Calidius's motion. Marcellus, overawed by his reproofs,
retracted his opinion. Thus most of the senate, intimidated by the expressions
of the consul, by the fears of a present army, and the threats of Pompey's
friends, unwillingly and reluctantly adopted Scipio's opinion, that Caesar
should disband his army by a certain day, and should he not do so, he should
he considered as acting against the state. Marcus Antonius, and Quintus
Cassius, tribunes of the people, interposed. The question was immediately
put on their interposition. Violent opinions were expressed; whoever spoke
with the greatest acrimony and cruelty was most highly commended by Caesar's
enemies.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.3": [1.3] The senate having broken
up in the evening, all who belonged to that order were summoned by Pompey.
He
applauded the forward, and secured their votes for the next day; the more
moderate he reproved and excited against Caesar. Many veterans, from all
parts, who had served in Pompey's armies, were invited to his standard
by the hopes of rewards and promotions. Several officers belonging to the
two legions, which had been delivered up by Caesar, were sent for. The
city and the comitium were crowded with tribunes, centurions, and veterans.
All the consul's friends, all Pompey's connections, all those who bore
any ancient enmity to Caesar, were forced into the senate house. By their
concourse and declarations the timid were awed, the irresolute confirmed,
and the greater part deprived of the power of speaking their sentiments
with freedom. Lucius Piso, the censor, offered to go to Caesar: as did
likewise Lucius Roscius, the praetor, to inform him of these affairs, and
require only six days' time to finish the business. Opinions were expressed
by some to the effect that commissioners should be sent to Caesar to acquaint
him with the senate's pleasure.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.4": [1.4] All these proposals were
rejected, and opposition made to them all, in the speeches of the consul,
Scipio, and Cato. An old grudge against Caesar and chagrin at a defeat
actuated Cato. Lentulus was wrought upon by the magnitude of his debts,
and the hopes of having the government of an army and provinces, and by
the presents which he expected from such princes as should receive the
title of friends of the Roman people, and boasted among his friends, that
he would be a second Sylla, to whom the supreme authority should return.
Similar hopes of a province and armies, which he expected to share with
Pompey on account of his connection with him, urged on Scipio; and moreover
[he was influenced by] the fear of being called to trial, and the adulation
and an ostentatious display of himself and his friends in power, who at
that time had great influence in the republic, and courts of judicature.
Pompey himself, incited by Caesar's enemies, because he was unwilling that
any person should bear an equal degree of dignity, had wholly alienated
himself from Caesar's friendship, and procured a reconciliation with their
common enemies; the greatest part of whom he had himself brought upon Caesar
during his affinity with him. At the same time, chagrined at the disgrace
which he had incurred by converting the two legions from their expedition
through Asia and Syria, to [augment] his own power and authority, he was
anxious to bring matters to a war.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.5": [1.5] For these reasons every
thing was done in a hasty and disorderly manner, and neither was time given
to Caesar's relations to inform him [of the state of affairs] nor liberty
to the tribunes of the people to deprecate their own danger, nor even to
retain the last privilege, which Sylla had left them, the interposing their
authority; but on the seventh day they were obliged to think of their own
safety, which the most turbulent tribunes of the people were not accustomed
to attend to, nor to fear being called to an account for their actions,
till the eighth month. Recourse is had to that extreme and final decree
of the senate (which was never resorted to even by daring proposers except
when the city was in danger of being set on fire, or when the public safety
was despaired of). "That the consuls, praetors, tribunes of the people,
and proconsuls in the city, should take care that the state received no
injury." These decrees are dated the eighth day before the ides of January;
therefore, in the first five days, on which the senate could meet, from
the day on which Lentulus entered into his consulate, the two days of election
excepted, the severest and most virulent decrees were passed against Caesar's
government, and against those most illustrious characters, the tribunes
of the people. The latter immediately made their escape from the city,
and withdrew to Caesar, who was then at Ravenna, awaiting an answer to
his moderate demands; [to see] if matters could be brought to a peaceful
termination by any equitable act on the part of his enemies.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.6": [1.6] During the succeeding
days the senate is convened outside the city. Pompey repeated the same
things which he had declared through Scipio. He applauded the courage and
firmness of the senate, acquainted them with his force, and told them that
he had ten legions ready; that he was moreover informed and assured that
Caesar's soldiers were disaffected, and that he could not persuade them
to defend or even follow him. Motions were made in the senate concerning
other matters; that levies should be made through all Italy; that Faustus
Sylla should be sent as propraetor into Mauritania; that money should be
granted to Pompey from the public treasury. It was also put to the vote
that king Juba should be [honored with the title of] friend and ally. But
Marcellus said that he would not allow this motion for the present. Philip,
one of the tribunes, stopped [the appointment of] Sylla; the resolutions
respecting the other matters passed. The provinces, two of which were consular,
the remainder praetorian, were decreed to private persons; Scipio got Syria,
Lucius Domitius Gaul: Philip and Marcellus were omitted, from a private
motive, and their lots were not even admitted. To the other provinces praetors
were sent, nor was time granted as in former years, to refer to the people
on their appointment, nor to make them take the usual oath, and march out
of the city in a public manner, robed in the military habit, after offering
their vows: a circumstance which had never before happened. Both the consuls
leave the city, and private men had lictors in the city and capital, contrary
to all precedents of former times. Levies were made throughout Italy, arms
demanded, and money exacted from the municipal towns, and violently taken
from the temples. All distinctions between things human and divine, are
confounded.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.7": [1.7] These things being made
known to Caesar, he harangued his soldiers; he reminded them "of the wrongs
done to him at all times by his enemies, and complained that Pompey had
been alienated from him and led astray by them through envy and a malicious
opposition to his glory, though he had always favored and promoted Pompey's
honor and dignity. He complained that an innovation had been introduced
into the republic, that the intercession of the tribunes, which had been
restored a few years before by Sylla, was branded as a crime, and suppressed
by force of arms; that Sylla, who had stripped the tribunes of every other
power, had, nevertheless, left the privilege of intercession unrestrained;
that Pompey, who pretended to restore what they had lost, had taken away
the privileges which they formerly had; that whenever the senate decreed,
'that the magistrates should take care that the republic sustained no injury'
(by which words and decree the Roman people were obliged to repair to arms),
it was only when pernicious laws were proposed; when the tribunes attempted
violent measures; when the people seceded, and possessed themselves of
the temples and eminences of the city; (and these instances of former times,
he showed them were expiated by the fate of Saturninus and the Gracchi):
that nothing of this kind was attempted now, nor even thought of: that
no law was promulgated, no intrigue with the people going forward, no secession
made; he exhorted them to defend from the malice of his enemies the reputation
and honor of that general under whose command they had for nine years most
successfully supported the state; fought many successful battles, and subdued
all Gaul and Germany." The soldiers of the thirteenth legion, which was
present (for in the beginning of the disturbances he had called it out,
his other legions not having yet arrived), all cry out that they are ready
to defend their general, and the tribunes of the commons, from all injuries.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.8": [1.8] Having made himself acquainted
with the disposition of his soldiers, Caesar set off with that legion to
Ariminum, and there met the tribunes, who had fled to him for protection;
he called his other legions from winter quarters; and ordered them to follow
him. Thither came Lucius Caesar, a young man, whose father was a lieutenant-general
under Caesar. He, after concluding the rest of his speech, and stating
for what purpose he had come, told Caesar that he had commands of a private
nature for him from Pompey; that Pompey wished to clear himself to Caesar,
lest he should impute those actions which he did for the republic, to a
design of affronting him; that he had ever preferred the interest of the
state to his own private connections; that Caesar, too, for his own honor,
ought to sacrifice his desires and resentment to the public good, and not
vent his anger so violently against his enemies, lest in his hopes of injuring
them, he should injure the republic. He spoke a few words to the same purport
from himself, in addition to Pompey's apology. Roscius, the praetor, conferred
with Caesar almost in the same words, and on the same subject, and declared
that Pompey had empowered him to do so.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.9": [1.9] Though these things seemed
to have no tendency toward redressing his injuries, yet having got proper
persons by whom he could communicate his wishes to Pompey; he required
of them both, that, as they had conveyed Pompey's demands to him, they
should not refuse to convey his demands to Pompey; if by so little trouble
they could terminate a great dispute, and liberate all Italy from her fears.
"That the honor of the republic had ever been his first object, and dearer
to him than life; that he was chagrined, that the favor of the Roman people
was wrested from him by the injurious reports of his enemies; that he was
deprived of a half-year's command, and dragged back to the city, though
the people had ordered that regard should be paid to his suit for the consulate
at the next election, though he was not present; that, however, he had
patiently submitted to this loss of honor, for the sake of the republic;
that when he wrote letters to the senate, requiring that all persons should
resign the command of their armies, he did not obtain even that request;
that levies were made throughout Italy; that the two legions which had
been taken from him, under the pretense of the Parthian war, were kept
at home, and that the state was in arms. To what did all these things tend,
unless to his ruin? But, nevertheless, he was ready to condescend to any
terms, and to endure every thing for the sake of the republic. Let Pompey
go to his own province; let them both disband their armies; let all persons
in Italy lay down their arms; let all fears be removed from the city; let
free elections, and the whole republic be resigned to the direction of
the senate and Roman people. That these things might be the more easily
performed, and conditions secured and confirmed by oath, either let Pompey
come to Caesar, or allow Caesar to go to him; it might be that all their
disputes would be settled by an interview."
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.10": [1.10] Roscius and Lucius
Caesar, having received this message, went to Capua, where they met the
consuls and Pompey, and declared to them Caesar's terms. Having deliberated
on the matter, they replied, and sent written proposals to him by the same
persons, the purport of which was, that Caesar should return into Gaul,
leave Ariminum, and disband his army: if he complied with this, that Pompey
would go to Spain. In the mean time, until security was given that Caesar
would perform his promises, that the consuls and Pompey would not give
over their levies.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.11": [1.11] It was not an equitable
proposal, to require that Caesar should quit Ariminum and return to his
province; but that he [Pompey] should himself retain his province and the
legions that belonged to another, and desire that Caesar's army should
be disbanded, while he himself was making new levies: and that he should
merely promise to go to his province, without naming the day on which he
would set out; so that if he should not set out till after Caesar's consulate
expired, yet he would not appear bound by any religious scruples about
asserting a falsehood. But his not granting time for a conference, nor
promising to set out to meet him, made the expectation of peace appear
very hopeless. Caesar, therefore, sent Marcus Antonius, with five cohorts
from Ariminum to Arretium; he himself staid at Ariminum with two legions,
with the intention of raising levies there. He secured Pisaurus, Fanum,
and Ancona, with a cohort each.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.12": [1.12] In the mean time, being
informed that Thermus the praetor was in possession of Iguvium, with five
cohorts, and was fortifying the town, but that the affections of all the
inhabitants were very well inclined toward himself, he detached Curio with
three cohorts, which he had at Ariminum and Pisaurus. Upon notice of his
approach, Thermus, distrusting the affections of the townsmen, drew his
cohorts out of it and made his escape; his soldiers deserted him on the
road, and returned home. Curio recovered Iguvium, with the cheerful concurrence
of all the inhabitants. Caesar, having received an account of this, and
relying on the affections of the municipal towns, drafted all the cohorts
of the thirteenth legion from the garrison, and set out for Auximum, a
town into which Attius had brought his cohorts, and of which he had taken
possession, and from which he had sent senators round about the country
of Picenum, to raise new levies.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.13": [1.13] Upon news of Caesar's
approach, the senate of Auximum went in a body to Attius Varus; and told
him that it was not a subject for them to determine upon: yet neither they,
nor the rest of the freemen would suffer Caius Caesar, a general, who had
merited so well of the republic, after performing such great achievements,
to be excluded from their town and walls; wherefore he ought to pay some
regard to the opinion of posterity, and his own danger. Alarmed at this
declaration, Attius Varus drew out of the town the garrison which he had
introduced, and fled. A fear of Caesar's front rank having pursued him,
obliged him to halt, and when the battle began, Varus is deserted by his
troops: some of them disperse to their homes, the rest come over to Caesar;
and along with them, Lucius Pupius, the chief centurion, is taken prisoner
and brought to Caesar. He had held the same rank before in Cneius Pompey's
army. But Caesar applauded the soldiers of Attius, set Pupius at liberty,
returned thanks to the people of Auximum, and promised to be grateful for
their conduct.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.14": [1.14] Intelligence of this
being brought to Rome, so great a panic spread on a sudden that when Lentulus,
the consul, came to open the treasury, to deliver money to Pompey by the
senate's decree, immediately on opening the hallowed door he fled from
the city. For it was falsely rumored that Caesar was approaching, and that
his cavalry were already at the gates. Marcellus, his colleague, followed
him, and so did most of the magistrates. Cneius Pompey had left the city
the day before, and was on his march to those legions which he had received
from Caesar, and had disposed in winter quarters in Apulia. The levies
were stopped within the city. No place on this side of Capua was thought
secure. At Capua they first began to take courage and to rally, and determined
to raise levies in the colonies, which had been sent thither by the Julian
law: and Lentulus brought into the public market place the gladiators which
Caesar maintained there for the entertainment of the people, and confirmed
them in their liberty, and gave them horses and ordered them to attend
him; but afterward, being warned by his friends that this action was censured
by the judgment of all, he distributed them among the slaves of the district
of Campania, to keep guard there.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.15": [1.15] Caesar, having moved
forward from Auximum, traversed the whole country of Picenum. All the governors
in these countries most cheerfully received him, and aided his army with
every necessary. Embassadors came to him even from Cingulum, a town which
Labienus had laid out and built at his own expense, and offered most earnestly
to comply with his orders. He demanded soldiers: they sent them. In the
mean time, the twelfth legion came to join Caesar; with these two he marched
to Asculum, the chief town of Picenum. Lentulus Spinther occupied that
town with ten cohorts; but, on being informed of Caesar's approach, he
fled from the town, and, in attempting to bring off his cohorts with him,
was deserted by a great part of his men. Being left on the road with a
small number, he fell in with Vibullius Rufus, who was sent by Pompey into
Picenum to confirm the people [in their allegiance]. Vibullius, being informed
by him of the transactions in Picenum, takes his soldiers from him and
dismisses him. He collects, likewise, from the neighboring countries, as
many cohorts as he can from Pompey's new levies. Among them he meets with
Ulcilles Hirrus fleeing from Camerinum, with six cohorts, which he had
in the garrison there; by a junction with which he made up thirteen cohorts.
With them he marched by hasty journeys to Corfinium, to Domitius Aenobarbus,
and informed him that Caesar was advancing with two legions. Domitius had
collected about twenty cohorts from Alba, and the Marsians, Pelignians,
and neighboring states.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.16": [1.16] Caesar, having recovered
Asculum and driven out Lentulus, ordered the soldiers that had deserted
from him to be sought out and a muster to be made; and, having delayed
for one day there to provide corn, he marched to Corfinium. On his approach,
five cohorts, sent by Domitius from the town, were breaking down a bridge
which was over the river, at three miles' distance from it. An engagement
taking place there with Caesar's advanced-guard, Domitius's men were quickly
beaten off from the bridge and retreated precipitately into the town. Caesar,
having marched his legions over, halted before the town and encamped close
by the walls.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.17": [1.17] Domitius, upon observing
this, sent messengers well acquainted with the country, encouraged by a
promise of being amply rewarded, with dispatches to Pompey to Apulia, to
beg and entreat him to come to his assistance. That Caesar could be easily
inclosed by the two armies, through the narrowness of the country, and
prevented from obtaining supplies: unless he did so, that he and upward
of thirty cohorts, and a great number of senators and Roman knights, would
be in extreme danger. In the mean time he encouraged his troops, disposed
engines on the walls, and assigned to each man a particular part of the
city to defend. In a speech to the soldiers he promised them lands out
of his own estate; to every private soldier four acres, and a corresponding
share to the centurions and veterans.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.18": [1.18] In the mean time, word
was brought to Caesar that the people of Sulmo, a town about seven miles
distant from Corfinium, were ready to obey his orders, but were prevented
by Quintus Lucretius, a senator, and Attius, a Pelignian, who were in possession
of the town with a garrison of seven cohorts. He sent Marcus Antonius thither,
with five cohorts of the eighth legion. The inhabitants, as soon as they
saw our standards, threw open their gates, and all the people, both citizens
and soldiers, went out to meet and welcome Antonius. Lucretius and Attius
leaped off the walls. Attius, being brought before Antonius, begged that
he might be sent to Caesar. Antonius returned the same day on which he
had set out with the cohorts and Attius. Caesar added these cohorts to
his own army, and sent Attius away in safety. The three first days Caesar
employed in fortifying his camp with strong works, in bringing in corn
from the neighboring free towns, and waiting for the rest of his forces.
Within the three days the eighth legion came to him, and twenty-two cohorts
of the new levies in Gaul, and about three hundred horse from the king
of Noricum. On their arrival he made a second camp on another part of the
town, and gave the command of it to Curio. He determined to surround the
town with a rampart and turrets during the remainder of the time. Nearly
at the time when the greatest part of the work was completed, all the messengers
sent to Pompey returned.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.19": [1.19] Having read Pompey's
letter, Domitius, concealing the truth, gave out in council that Pompey
would speedily come to their assistance; and encouraged them not to despond,
but to provide every thing necessary for the defense of the town. He held
private conferences with a few of his most intimate friends, and determined
on the design of fleeing. As Domitius's countenance did not agree with
his words, and he did every thing with more confusion and fear than he
had shown on the preceding days, and as he had several private meetings
with his friends, contrary to his usual practice, in order to take their
advice, and as he avoided all public councils and assemblies of the people,
the truth could be no longer hid nor dissembled; for Pompey had written
back in answer, "That he would not put matters to the last hazard; that
Domitius had retreated into the town of Corfinium without either his advice
or consent. Therefore, if any opportunity should offer, he [Domitius] should
come to him with the whole force." But the blockade and works round the
town prevented his escape.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.20": [1.20] Domitius's design being
noised abroad, the soldiers in Corfinium early in the evening began to
mutiny, and held a conference with each other by their tribunes and centurions,
and the most respectable among themselves: "that they were besieged by
Caesar; that his works and fortifications were almost finished; that their
general, Domitius, on whose hopes and expectations they had confided, had
thrown them off, and was meditating his own escape; that they ought to
provide for their own safety." At first the Marsians differed in opinion,
and possessed themselves of that part of the town which they thought the
strongest. And so violent a dispute arose between them, that they attempted
to fight and decide it by arms. However, in a little time, by messengers
sent from one side to the other, they were informed of Domitius's meditated
flight, of which they were previously ignorant. Therefore they all with
one consent brought Domitius into public view, gathered round him, and
guarded him; and sent deputies out of their number to Caesar, to say that
they were ready to throw open their gates, to do whatever he should order,
and deliver up Domitius alive into his hands."
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.21": [1.21] Upon intelligence of
these matters, though Caesar thought it of great consequence to become
master of the town as soon as possible, and to transfer the cohorts to
his own camp, lest any change should be wrought on their inclinations by
bribes, encouragement, or ficticious messages, because in war great events
are often brought about by trifling circumstances; yet, dreading lest the
town should be plundered by the soldiers entering into it, and taking advantage
of the darkness of the night, he commended the persons who came to him,
and sent them back to the town, and ordered the gates and walls to be secured.
He disposed his soldiers on the works which he had begun, not at certain
intervals, as was his practice before, but in one continued range of sentinels
and stations, so that they touched each other, and formed a circle round
the whole fortification; he ordered the tribunes and general officers to
ride round; and exhorted them not only to be on their guard against sallies
from the town, but also to watch that no single person should get out privately.
Nor was any man so negligent or drowsy as to sleep that night. To so great
height was their expectation raised, that they were carried away, heart
and soul, each to different objects, what would become of the Corfinians,
what of Domitius, what of Lentulus, what of the rest; what event would
be the consequence of another.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.22": [1.22] About the fourth watch,
Lentulus Spinther said to our sentinels and guards from the walls, that
he desired to have an interview with Caesar, if permission were given him.
Having obtained it, he was escorted out of town; nor did the soldiers of
Domitius leave him till they brought him into Caesar's presence. He pleaded
with Caesar for his life, and entreated him to spare him, and reminded
him of their former friendship; and acknowledged that Caesar's favors to
him were very great; in that through his interest he had been admitted
into the college of priests; in that after his praetorship he had been
appointed to the government of Spain; in that he had been assisted by him
in his suit for the consulate. Caesar interrupted him in his speech, and
told him, "that he had not left his province to do mischief [to any man],
but to protect himself from the injuries of his enemies; to restore to
their dignity the tribunes of the people who had been driven out of the
city on his account, and to assert his own liberty, and that of the Roman
people, who were oppressed by a few factious men. Encouraged by this address,
Lentulus begged leave to return to the town, that the security which he
had obtained for himself might be an encouragement to the rest to hope
for theirs; saying that some were so terrified that they were induced to
make desperate attempts on their own lives. Leave being granted him, he
departed.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.23": [1.23] When day appeared,
Caesar ordered all the senators and their children, the tribunes of the
soldiers, and the Roman knights to be brought before him. Among the persons
of senatorial rank were Lucius Domitius, Publius Lentulus Spinther, Lucius
Vibullius Rufus, Sextus Quintilius Varus, the quaestor, and Lucius Rubrius,
besides the son of Domitius, and several other young men, and a great number
of Roman knights and burgesses, whom Domitius had summoned from the municipal
towns. When they were brought before him he protected them from the insolence
and taunts of the soldiers; told them in few words that they had not made
him a grateful return, on their part, for his very extraordinary kindness
to them, and dismissed them all in safety. Sixty sestertia, which Domitius
had brought with him and lodged in the public treasury, being brought to
Caesar by the magistrates of Corfinium, he gave them back to Domitius,
that he might not appear more moderate with respect to the life of men
than in money matters, though he knew that it was public money, and had
been given by Pompey to pay his army. He ordered Domitius's soldiers to
take the oath to himself, and that day decamped and performed the regular
march. He staid only seven days before Corfinium, and marched into Apulia
through the country of the Marrucinians, Frentanian's and Larinates.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.24": [1.24] Pompey, being informed
of what had passed at Corfinium, marches from Luceria to Canusium, and
thence to Brundusium. He orders all the forces raised every where by the
new levies to repair to him. He gives arms to the slaves that attended
the flocks, and appoints horses for them. Of these he made up about three
hundred horse. Lucius, the praetor, fled from Alba, with six cohorts: Rutilus,
Lupus, the praetor, from Tarracina, with three. These having descried Caesar's
cavalry at a distance, which were commanded by Bivius Curius, and having
deserted the praetor, carried their colors to Curius and went over to him.
In like manner, during the rest of his march, several cohorts fell in with
the main body of Caesar's army, others with his horse. Cneius Magius, from
Cremona, engineer-general to Pompey, was taken prisoner on the road and
brought to Caesar, but sent back by him to Pompey with this message: "As
hitherto he had not been allowed an interview, and was now on his march
to him at Brundusium, that it deeply concerned the commonwealth and general
safety that he should have an interview with Pompey; and that the same
advantage could not be gained at a great distance when the proposals were
conveyed to them by others, as if terms were argued by them both in person."
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.25": [1.25] Having delivered this
message he marched to Brundusium with six legions, four of them veterans:
the rest those which he had raised in the late levy and completed on his
march, for he had sent all Domitius's cohorts immediately from Corfinium
to Sicily. He discovered that the consuls were gone to Dyrrachium with
a considerable part of the army, and that Pompey remained at Brundusium
with twenty cohorts; but could not find out, for a certainty, whether Pompey
staid behind to keep possession of Brundusium, that he might the more easily
command the whole Adriatic sea, with the extremities of Italy and the coast
of Greece, and be able to conduct the war on either side of it, or whether
he remained there for want of shipping; and, being afraid that Pompey would
come to the conclusion that he ought not to relinquish Italy, he determined
to deprive him of the means of communication afforded by the harbor of
Brundusium. The plan of his work was as follows: Where the mouth of the
port was narrowest he threw up a mole of earth on either side, because
in these places the sea was shallow. Having gone out so far that the mole
could not be continued in the deep water, he fixed double floats, thirty
feet on either side, before the mole. These he fastened with four anchors
at the four corners, that they might not be carried away by the waves.
Having completed and secured them, he then joined to them other floats
of equal size. These he covered over with earth and mold, that he might
not be prevented from access to them to defend them, and in the front and
on both sides he protected them with a parapet of wicker work; and on every
fourth one raised a turret, two stories high, to secure them the better
from being attacked by the shipping and set on fire.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.26": [1.26] To counteract this,
Pompey fitted out large merchant ships, which he found in the harbor of
Brundusium: on them he erected turrets three stories high, and, having
furnished them with several engines and all sorts of weapons, drove them
among Caesar's works, to break through the floats and interrupt the works;
thus there happened skirmishes every day at a distance with slings, arrows,
and other weapons. Caesar conducted matters as if he thought that the hopes
of peace were not yet to be given up. And though he was very much surprised
that Magius, whom he had sent to Pompey with a message, was not sent back
to him; and though his attempting a reconciliation often retarded the vigorous
prosecution of his plans, yet he thought that he ought by all means to
persevere in the same line of conduct. He therefore sent Caninius Rebilus
to have an interview with Scribonius Libo, his intimate friend and relation.
He charges him to exhort Libo to effect a peace, but, above all things,
requires that he should be admitted to an interview with Pompey. He declared
that he had great hopes, if that were allowed him, that the consequence
would be that both parties would lay down their arms on equal terms; that
a great share of the glory and reputation of that event would redound to
Libo, if, through his advice and agency, hostilities should be ended. Libo,
having parted from the conference with Caninius, went to Pompey, and, shortly
after, returns with answer that, as the consuls were absent, no treaty
of composition could be engaged in without them. Caesar therefore thought
it time at length to give over the attempt which he had often made in vain,
and act with energy in the war.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.27": [1.27] When Caesar's works
were nearly half finished, and after nine days were spent in them, the
ships which had conveyed the first division of the army to Dyrrachium being
sent back by the consuls, returned to Brundusium. Pompey, either frightened
at Caesar's works or determined from the beginning to quit Italy, began
to prepare for his departure on the arrival of the ships; and the more
effectually to retard Caesar's attack, lest his soldiers should force their
way into the town at the moment of his departure, he stopped up the gates,
built walls across the streets and avenues, sunk trenches across the ways,
and in them fixed palisadoes and sharp stakes, which he made level with
the ground by means of hurdles and clay. But he barricaded with large beams
fastened in the ground and sharpened at the ends two passages and roads
without the walls, which led to the port. After making these arrangements,
he ordered his soldiers to go on board without noise, and disposed here
and there, on the wall and turrets, some light-armed veterans, archers
and slingers. These he designed to call off by a certain signal, when all
the soldiers were embarked, and left row-galleys for them in a secure place.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.28": [1.28] The people of Brundusium,
irritated by the insolence of Pompey's soldiers, and the insults received
from Pompey himself, were in favor of Caesar's party. Therefore, as soon
as they were aware of Pompey's departure, while his men were running up
and down, and busied about their voyage, they made signs from the tops
of the houses: Caesar, being apprised of the design by them, ordered scaling-ladders
to be got ready, and his men to take arms, that he might not lose any opportunity
of coming to an action. Pompey weighed anchor at nightfall. The soldiers
who had been posted on the wall to guard it, were called off by the signal
which had been agreed on, and knowing the roads, ran down to the ships.
Caesar's soldiers fixed their ladders and scaled the walls: but being cautioned
by the people to beware of the hidden stakes and covered trenches, they
halted, and being conducted by the inhabitants by a long circuit, they
reached the port, and captured with their long boats and small craft two
of Pompey's ships, full of soldiers, which had struck against Caesar's
moles.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.29": [1.29] Though Caesar highly
approved of collecting a fleet, and crossing the sea, and pursuing Pompey
before he could strengthen himself with his transmarine auxiliaries, with
the hope of bringing the war to a conclusion, yet he dreaded the delay
and length of time necessary to effect it: because Pompey, by collecting
all his ships, had deprived him of the means of pursuing him at present.
The only resource left to Caesar, was to wait for a fleet from the distant
regions of Gaul, Picenum, and the straits of Gibraltar. But this, on account
of the season of the year, appeared tedious and troublesome. He was unwilling
that, in the mean time, the veteran army, and the two Spains, one of which
was bound to Pompey by the strongest obligations, should be confirmed in
his interest; that auxiliaries and cavalry should be provided, and Gaul
and Italy reduced in his absence.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.30": [1.30] Therefore, for the
present he relinquished all intention of pursuing Pompey, and resolved
to march to Spain, and commanded the magistrates of the free towns to procure
him ships, and to have them convoyed to Brundusium. He detached Valerius,
his lieutenant, with one legion to Sardinia; Curio, the propraetor, to
Sicily with three legions; and ordered him, when he had recovered Sicily,
to immediately transport his army to Africa. Marcus Cotta was at this time
governor of Sardinia: Marcus Cato, of Sicily: and Tubero, by the lots,
should have had the government of Africa. The Caralitani, as soon as they
heard that Valerius was sent against them, even before he left Italy, of
their own accord drove Cotta out of the town; who, terrified because he
understood that the whole province was combined [against him], fled from
Sardinia to Africa. Cato was in Sicily, repairing the old ships of war,
and demanding new ones from the states, and these things he performed with
great zeal. He was raising levies of Roman citizens, among the Lucani and
Brutii, by his lieutenants, and exacting a certain quota of horse and foot
from the states of Sicily. When these things were nearly completed, being
informed of Curio's approach, he made a complaint that he was abandoned
and betrayed by Pompey, who had undertaken an unnecessary war, without
making any preparation, and when questioned by him and other members in
the senate, had assured them that every thing was ready and provided for
the war. After having made these complaints in a public assembly, he fled
from his province.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.31": [1.31] Valerius found Sardinia,
and Curio, Sicily, deserted by their governors when they arrived there
with their armies. When Tubero arrived in Africa, he found Attius Varus
in the government of the province, who, having lost his cohorts, as already
related, at Auximum, had straightway fled to Africa, and finding it without
a governor, had seized it of his own accord, and making levies, had raised
two legions. From his acquaintance with the people and country, and his
knowledge of that province, he found the means of effecting this; because
a few years before, at the expiration of his praetorship, he had obtained
that province. He, when Tubero came to Utica with his fleet, prevented
his entering the port or town, and did not suffer his son, though laboring
under sickness, to set foot on shore; but obliged him to weigh anchor and
quit the place.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.32": [1.32] When these affairs
were dispatched, Caesar, that there might be an intermission from labor
for the rest of the season, drew off his soldiers to the nearest municipal
towns, and set off in person for Rome. Having assembled the senate, he
reminded them of the injustice of his enemies; and told them, "That he
aimed at no extraordinary honor, but had waited for the time appointed
by law, for standing candidate for the consulate, being contented with
what was allowed to every citizen. That a bill had been carried by the
ten tribunes of the people (notwithstanding the resistance of his enemies,
and a very violent opposition from Cato, who in his usual manner, consumed
the day by a tedious harangue) that he should be allowed to stand candidate,
though absent, even in the consulship of Pompey; and if the latter disapproved
of the bill, why did he allow it to pass? if he approved of it, why should
he debar him [Caesar] from the people's favor? He made mention of his own
patience, in that he had freely proposed that all armies should be disbanded,
by which he himself would suffer the loss both of dignity and honor. He
urged the virulence of his enemies, who refused to comply with what they
required from others, and had rather that all things should be thrown into
confusion, than that they should lose their power and their armies. He
expatiated on their injustice, in taking away his legions: their cruelty
and insolence in abridging the privileges of the tribunes; the proposals
he had made, and his entreaties of an interview which had been refused
him. For which reasons, he begged and desired that they would undertake
the management of the republic, and unite with him in the administration
of it. But if through fear they declined it, he would not be a burden to
them, but take the management of it on himself. That deputies ought to
be sent to Pompey, to propose a reconciliation; as he did not regard what
Pompey had lately asserted in the senate, that authority was acknowledged
to
be vested in those persons to whom embassadors were sent, and fear implied
in those that sent them. That these were the sentiments of low, weak minds:
that for his part, as he had made it his study to surpass others in glory,
so he was desirous of excelling them in justice and equity."
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.33": [1.33] The senate approved
of sending deputies, but none could be found fit to execute the commission:
for every person, from his own private fears, declined the office. For
Pompey, on leaving the city, had declared in the open senate, that he would
hold in the same degree of estimation, those who staid in Rome and those
in Caesar's camp. Thus three days were wasted in disputes and excuses.
Besides, Lucius Metellus, one of the tribunes, was suborned by Caesar's
enemies, to prevent this, and to embarrass every thing else which Caesar
should propose. Caesar having discovered his intention, after spending
several days to no purpose, left the city, in order that he might not lose
any more time, and went to Transalpine Gaul, without effecting what he
had intended.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.34": [1.34] On his arrival there,
he was informed that Vibullius Rufus, whom he had taken a few days before
at Corfinium, and set at liberty, was sent by Pompey into Spain; and that
Domitius also was gone to seize Massilia with seven row-galleys, which
were fitted up by some private persons at Igilium and Cosa, and which he
had manned with his own slaves, freedmen, and colonists: and that some
young noble men of Massilia had been sent before him; whom Pompey, when
leaving Rome had exhorted, that the late services of Caesar should not
erase from their minds the memory of his former favors. On receiving this
message, the Massilians had shut their gates against Caesar, and invited
over to them the Albici, who had formerly been in alliance with them, and
who inhabited the mountains that overhung Massilia: they had likewise conveyed
the corn from the surrounding country, and from all the forts into the
city; had opened armories in the city; and were repairing the walls, the
fleet, and the gates.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.35": [1.35] Caesar sent for fifteen
of the principal persons of Massilia to attend him. To prevent the war
commencing among them, he remonstrates [in the following language]; "that
they ought to follow the precedent set by all Italy, rather than submit
to the will of any one man." He made use of such arguments as he thought
would tend to bring them to reason. The deputies reported his speech to
their countrymen, and by the authority of the state bring him back this
answer: "That they understood that the Roman people was divided into two
factions: that they had neither judgment nor abilities to decide which
had the juster cause; but that the heads of these factions were Cneius
Pompey and Caius Caesar, the two patrons of the state: the former of whom
had granted to their state the lands of the Vocae Arecomici, and Helvii;
the latter had assigned them a part of his conquests in Gaul, and had augmented
their revenue. Wherefore, having received equal favors from both, they
ought to show equal affection to both, and assist neither against the other,
nor admit either into their city or harbors."
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.36": [1.36] While this treaty was
going forward, Domitius arrived at Massilia with his fleet, and was received
into the city, and made governor of it. The chief management of the war
was intrusted to him. At his command they send the fleet to all parts;
they seize all the merchantmen they could meet with, and carry them into
the harbor; they apply the nails, timber, and rigging, with which they
were furnished to rig and refit their other vessels. They lay up in the
public stores, all the corn that was found in the ships, and reserve the
rest of their lading and convoy for the siege of the town, should such
an event take place. Provoked at such ill treatment, Caesar led three legions
against Massilia, and resolved to provide turrets, and vineae to assault
the town, and to build twelve ships at Arelas, which being completed and
rigged in thirty days (from the time the timber was cut down), and being
brought to Massilia, he put under the command of Decimus Brutus; and left
Caius Trebonius his lieutenant, to invest the city.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.37": [1.37] While he was preparing
and getting these things in readiness, he sent Caius Fabius one of his
lieutenants into Spain with three legions, which he had disposed to winter
quarters in Narbo, and the neighboring country; and ordered him immediately
to seize the passes of the Pyrenees, which were at that time occupied by
detachments from Lucius Afranius, one of Pompey's lieutenants. He desired
the other legions, which were passing the winter at a great distance, to
follow close after him. Fabius, according to his orders, by using expedition,
dislodged the party from the hills, and by hasty marches came up with the
army of Afranius.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.38": [1.38] On the arrival of Vibullius
Rufus, whom, we have already mentioned, Pompey had sent into Spain, Afranius,
Petreius, and Varro, his lieutenants (one of whom had the command of Hither
Spain, with three legions; the second of the country from the forest of
Castulo to the river Guadiana with two legions; the third from the river
Guadiana to the country of the Vettones and Lusitania, with the like number
of legions) divided among themselves their respective departments. Petreius
was to march from Lusitania through the Vettones, and join Afranius with
all his forces; Varro was to guard all Further Spain with what legions
he had. These matters being settled, reinforcements of horse and foot were
demanded from Lusitania, by Petreius; from the Celtiberi, Cantabri, and
all the barbarous nations which border on the ocean, by Afranius. When
they were raised, Petreius immediately marched through the Vettones to
Afranius. They resolved by joint consent to carry on the war in the vicinity
of Herba, on account of the advantages of its situation.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.39": [1.39] Afranius, as above
mentioned, had three legions, Petreius two. There were besides about eighty
cohorts raised in Hither and Further Spain (of which, the troops belonging
to the former province had shields, those of the latter targets), and about
five thousand horse raised in both provinces. Caesar had sent his legions
into Spain, with about six thousand auxiliary foot, and three thousand
horse, which had served under him in all his former wars, and the same
number from Gaul, which he himself had provided, having expressly called
out all the most noble and valiant men of each state. The bravest of these
were from the Aquitani and the mountaineers, who border on the Province
in Gaul. He had been informed that Pompey was marching through Mauritania
with his legions to Spain, and would shortly arrive. He at the same time
borrowed money from the tribunes and centurions, which he distributed among
his soldiers. By this proceeding he gained two points; he secured the interest
of the centurions by this pledge in his hands, and by his liberality he
purchased the affections of his army.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.40": [1.40] Fabius sounded the
inclinations of the neighboring states by letters and messengers. He had
made two bridges over the river Segre, at the distance of four miles from
each other. He sent foraging parties over these bridges, because he had
already consumed all the forage that was on his side of the river. The
generals of Pompey's army did almost the same thing, and for the same reason:
and the horse had frequent skirmishes with each other. When two of Fabius's
legions had, as was their constant practice, gone forth as the usual protection
to the foragers, and had crossed the river, and the baggage, and all the
horse were following them, on a sudden, from the weight of the cattle,
and the mass of water, the bridge fell, and all the horse were cut off
from the main army, which being known to Petreius and Afranius, from the
timber and hurdles that were carried down the river, Afranius immediately
crossed his own bridge, which communicated between his camp and the town,
with four legions and all the cavalry, and marched against Fabius's two
legions. When his approach was announced, Lucius Plancus, who had the command
of those legions, compelled by the emergency, took post on a rising ground;
and drew up his army with two fronts, that it might not be surrounded by
the cavalry. Thus, though engaged with superior numbers, he sustained the
furious charge of the legions and the horse. When the battle was begun
by the horse, there were observed at a distance by both sides the colors
of two legions, which Caius Fabius had sent round by the further bridge
to reinforce our men, suspecting, as the event verified, that the enemy's
generals would take advantage of the opportunity which fortune had put
in their way, to attack our men. Their approach put an end to the battle,
and each general led back his legions to their respective camps.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.41": [1.41] In two days after Caesar
came to the camp with nine hundred horse, which he had retained for a body
guard. The bridge which had been broken down by the storm was almost repaired,
and he ordered it to be finished in the night. Being acquainted with the
nature of the country, he left behind him six cohorts to guard the bridge,
the camp, and all his baggage, and the next day set off in person for Ilerda,
with all his forces drawn up in three lines, and halted just before the
camp of Afranius, and having remained there a short time under arms, he
offered him battle on equal terms. When this affair was made, Afranius
drew out his forces, and posted them on the middle of a hill, near his
camp. When Caesar perceived that Afranius declined coming to an engagement,
he resolved to encamp at somewhat less than half a mile's distance from
the very foot of the mountain; and that his soldiers while engaged in their
works, might not be terrified by any sudden attack of the enemy, or disturbed
in their work, he ordered them not to fortify it with a wall, which must
rise high, and be seen at a distance, but draw, on the front opposite the
enemy, a trench fifteen feet broad. The first and second lines confined
under arms, as was from the first appointed. Behind them the third line
was carrying on the work without being seen; so that the whole was completed
before Afranius discovered that the camp was being fortified.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.42": [1.42] In the evening Caesar
drew his legions within this trench, and rested them under arms the next
night. The day following he kept his whole army within it, and as it was
necessary to bring materials from a considerable distance, he for the present
pursued the same plan in his work; and to each legion, one after the other,
he assigned one side of the camp to fortify, and ordered trenches of the
same magnitude to be cut: he kept the rest of the legions under arms without
baggage to oppose the enemy. Afranius and Petreius, to frighten us and
obstruct the work, drew out their forces at the very foot of the mountain,
and challenged us to battle. Caesar, however, did not interrupt his work,
relying on the protection of the three legions, and the strength of the
fosse. After staying for a short time, and advancing no great distance
from the bottom of the hill, they led back their forces to their camp.
The third day Caesar fortified his camp with a rampart, and ordered the
other cohorts which he had left in the upper camp, and his baggage to be
removed to it.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.43": [1.43] Between the town of
Ilerda and the next hill, on which Afranius and Petreius were encamped,
there was a plain about three hundred paces broad, and near the middle
of it an eminence somewhat raised above the level: Caesar hoped that if
he could get possession of this and fortify it, he should be able to cut
off the enemy from the town, the bridge, and all the stores which they
had laid up in the town. In expectation of this he led three legions out
of the camp, and, drawing up his army in an advantageous position, he ordered
the advanced men of one legion to hasten forward and seize the eminence.
Upon intelligence of this the cohorts which were on guard before Afranius's
camp were instantly sent a nearer way to occupy the same post. The two
parties engage, and as Afranius's men had reached the eminence first, our
men were repulsed, and, on a reinforcement being sent, they were obliged
to turn their backs and retreat to the standards of legions.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.44": [1.44] The manner of fighting
of those soldiers was to run forward with great impetuosity and boldly
take a post, and not to keep their ranks strictly, but to fight in small
scattered parties: if hard pressed they thought it no disgrace to retire
and give up the post, being accustomed to this manner of fighting among
the Lusitanians and other barbarous nations; for it commonly happens that
soldiers are strongly influenced by the customs of those countries in which
they have spent much time. This method, however, alarmed our men, who were
not used to such a description of warfare. For they imagined that they
were about to be surrounded on their exposed flank by the single men who
ran forward from their ranks; and they thought it their duty to keep their
ranks, and not to quit their colors, nor, without good reason to give up
the post which they had taken. Accordingly, when the advanced guard gave
way, the legion which was stationed on that wing did not keep its ground,
but retreated to the next hill.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.45": [1.45] Almost the whole army
being daunted at this, because it had occurred contrary to their expectations
and custom, Caesar encouraged his men and led the ninth legion to their
relief, and checked the insolent and eager pursuit of the enemy, and obliged
them, in their turn, to show their backs, and retreat to Ilerda, and take
post under the walls. But the soldiers of the ninth legion, being over
zealous to repair the dishonor which had been sustained, having rashly
pursued the fleeing enemy, advanced into disadvantageous ground and went
up to the foot of the mountain on which the town Ilerda was built. And
when they wished to retire they were again attacked by the enemy from the
rising ground. The place was craggy in the front and steep on either side,
and was so narrow that even three cohorts, drawn up in order of battle,
would fill it; but no relief could be sent on the flanks, and the horse
could be of no service to them when hard pressed. From the town, indeed,
the precipice inclined with a gentle slope for near four hundred paces.
Our men had to retreat this way, as they had, through their eagerness,
advanced too inconsiderately. The greatest contest was in this place, which
was much to the disadvantage of our troops, both on account of its narrowness,
and because they were posted at the foot of the mountain, so that no weapon
was thrown at them without effect; yet they exerted their valor and patience,
and bore every wound. The enemy's forces were increasing, and cohorts were
frequently sent to their aid from the camp through the town, that fresh
men might relieve the weary. Caesar was obliged to do the same, and relieve
the fatigued by sending cohorts to that post.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.46": [1.46] After the battle had
in this manner continued incessantly for five hours, and our men had suffered
much from superior numbers, having spent all their javelins, they drew
their swords and charged the enemy up the hill, and, having killed a few,
obliged the rest to fly. The cohorts being beaten back to the wall, and
some being driven by their fears into the town, an easy retreat was afforded
to our men. Our cavalry also, on either flank, though stationed on sloping
or low ground, yet bravely struggled up to the top of the hill, and, riding
between the two armies, made our retreat more easy and secure. Such were
the various turns of fortune in the battle. In the first encounter about
seventy of our men fell: among them Quintus Fulgenius, first centurion
of the second line of the fourteenth legion, who, for his extraordinary
valor, had been promoted from the lower ranks to that post. About six hundred
were wounded. Of Afranius's party there were killed Titus Caecilius, principal
centurion, and four other centurions, and above two hundred men.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.47": [1.47] But this opinion is
spread abroad concerning this day, that each party thought that they came
off conquerors. Afranius's soldiers, because, though they were esteemed
inferior in the opinion of all, yet they had stood our attack and sustained
our charge, and, at first, had kept the post on the hill which had been
the occasion of the dispute; and, in the first encounter, had obliged our
men to fly: but ours, because, notwithstanding the disadvantage of the
ground and the disparity of numbers, they had maintained the battle for
five hours, had advanced up the hill sword in hand, and had forced the
enemy to fly from the higher ground and driven them into the town. The
enemy fortified the hill, about which the contest had been, with strong
works and posted a garrison on it.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.48": [1.48] In two days after this
transaction, there happened an unexpected misfortune. For so great a storm
arose, that it was agreed that there were never seen higher floods in those
countries; it swept down the snow from all the mountains, and broke over
the banks of the river, and in one day carried away both the bridges which
Fabius had built- a circumstance which caused great difficulties to Caesar's
army. For as our camp, as already mentioned, was pitched between two rivers,
the Segre and Cinca, and as neither of these could be forded for the space
of thirty miles, they were all of necessity confined within these narrow
limits. Neither could the states, which had espoused Caesar's cause, furnish
him with corn, nor the troops, which had gone far to forage, return, as
they were stopped by the waters: nor could the convoys, coming from Italy
and Gaul, make their way to the camp. Besides, it was the most distressing
season of the year, when there was no corn in the blade, and it was nearly
ripe: and the states were exhausted, because Afranius had conveyed almost
all the corn, before Caesar's arrival, into Ilerda, and whatever he had
left, had been already consumed by Caesar. The cattle, which might have
served as a secondary resource against want, had been removed by the states
to a great distance on account of the war. They who had gone out to get
forage or corn, were chased by the light troops of the Lusitanians, and
the targeteers of Hither Spain, who were well acquainted with the country,
and could readily swim across the river, because it is the custom of all
those people not to join their armies without bladders.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.49": [1.49] But Afranius's army
had abundance of everything; a great stock of corn had been provided and
laid in long before, a large quantity was coming in from the whole province:
they had a good store of forage. The bridge of Ilerda afforded an opportunity
of getting all these without any danger, and the places beyond the bridge,
to which Caesar had no access, were as yet untouched.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.50": [1.50] Those floods continued
several days. Caesar endeavored to repair the bridges, but the height of
the water did not allow him: and the cohorts disposed along the banks did
not suffer them to be completed; and it was easy for them to prevent it,
both from the nature of the river and the height of the water, but especially
because their darts were thrown from the whole course of the bank on one
confined spot; and it was no easy matter at one and the same time to execute
a work in a very rapid flood, and to avoid the darts.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.51": [1.51] Intelligence was brought
to Afranius that the great convoys, which were on their march to Caesar,
had halted at the river. Archers from the Rutheni, and horse from the Gauls,
with a long train of baggage, according to the Gallic custom of traveling,
had arrived there; there were besides about six thousand people of all
descriptions, with slaves and freed men. But there was no order, or regular
discipline, as every one followed his own humor, and all traveled without
apprehension, taking the same liberty as on former marches. There were
several young noblemen, sons of senators, and of equestrian rank; there
were embassadors from several states; there were lieutenants of Caesar's.
The river stopped them all. To attack them by surprise, Afranius set out
in the beginning of the night, with all his cavalry and three legions,
and sent the horse on before, to fall on them unawares; but the Gallic
horse soon got themselves in readiness, and attacked them. Though but few,
they withstood the vast number of the enemy, as long as they fought on
equal terms; but when the legions began to approach, having lost a few
men, they retreated to the next mountains. The delay occasioned by this
battle was of great importance to the security of our men; for having gained
time, they retired to the higher grounds. There were missing that day about
two hundred bow-men, a few horse, and an inconsiderable number of servants
and baggage.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.52": [1.52] However, by all these
things, the price of provisions was raised, which is commonly a disaster
attendant, not only on a time of present scarcity, but on the apprehension
of future want. Provisions had now reached fifty denarii each bushel; and
the want of corn had diminished the strength of the soldiers; and the inconveniences
were increasing every day; and so great an alteration was wrought in a
few days, and fortune had so changed sides, that our men had to struggle
with the want of every necessary; while the enemy had an abundant supply
of all things, and were considered to have the advantage. Caesar demanded
from those states which had acceded to his alliance, a supply of cattle,
as they had but little corn. He sent away the camp followers to the more
distant states, and endeavored to remedy the present scarcity by every
resource in his power.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.53": [1.53] Afranius and Petreius,
and their friends, sent fuller and more circumstantial accounts of these
things to Rome, to their acquaintances. Report exaggerated them so that
the war appeared to be almost at an end. When these letters and dispatches
were received at Rome, a great concourse of people resorted to the house
of Afranius, and congratulations ran high; several went out of Italy to
Cneius Pompey; some of them, to be the first to bring him the intelligence;
others, that they might not be thought to have waited the issue of the
war, and to have come last of all.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.54": [1.54] When Caesar's affairs
were in this unfavorable position, and all the passes were guarded by the
soldiers and horse of Afranius, and the bridges could not be prepared,
Caesar ordered his soldiers to make ships of the kind that his knowledge
of Britain a few years before had taught him. First, the keels and ribs
were made of light timber, then, the rest of the hulk of the ships was
wrought with wicker work, and covered over with hides. When these were
finished, he drew them down to the river in wagons in one night, a distance
of twenty-two miles from his camp, and transported in them some soldiers
across the river, and on a sudden took possession of a hill adjoining the
bank. This he immediately fortified, before he was perceived by the enemy.
To this he afterward transported a legion: and having begun a bridge on
both sides, he finished it in two days. By this means, he brought safe
to his camp, the convoys, and those who had gone out to forage; and began
to prepare a conveyance for the provisions.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.55": [1.55] The same day he made
a great part of his horse pass the river, who, falling on the foragers
by surprise as they were dispersed without any suspicions, intercepted
an incredible number of cattle and people; and when some Spanish light-armed
cohorts were sent to reinforce the enemy, our men judiciously divided themselves
into two parts, the one to protect the spoil, the other to resist the advancing
foe, and to beat them back, and they cut off from the rest and surrounded
one cohort, which had rashly ventured out of the line before the others,
and after putting it to the sword, returned safe with considerable booty
to the camp over the same bridge.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.56": [1.56] While these affairs
are going forward at Ilerda, the Massilians, adopting the advice of Domitius,
prepared seventeen ships of war, of which eleven were decked. To these
they add several smaller vessels, that our fleet might be terrified by
numbers; they man them with a great number of archers and of the Albici,
of whom mention has been already made, and these they incited by rewards
and promises. Domitius required certain ships for his own use, which he
manned with colonists and shepherds, whom he had brought along with him.
A fleet being thus furnished with every necessary, he advanced with great
confidence against our ships, commanded by Decimus Brutus. It was stationed
at an island opposite to Massilia.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.57": [1.57] Brutus was much inferior
in number of ships; but Caesar had appointed to that fleet the bravest
men selected from all his legions, antesignani and centurions, who had
requested to be employed in that service. They had provided iron hooks
and harpoons, and had furnished themselves with a vast number of javelins,
darts, and missiles. Thus prepared, and being apprised of the enemy's approach,
they put out from the harbor, and engaged the Massilians. Both sides fought
with great courage and resolution; nor did the Albici, a hardy people,
bred on the highlands and inured to arms, fall much short of our men in
valor: and being lately come from the Massilians, they retained in their
minds their recent promises: and the wild shepherds, encouraged by the
hope of liberty, were eager to prove their zeal in the presence of their
masters.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.58": [1.58] The Massilians themselves,
confiding in the quickness of their ships, and the skill of their pilots,
eluded ours, and evaded the shock, and as long as they were permitted by
clear space, lengthening their line they endeavored to surround us, or
to attack single ships with several of theirs, or to run across our ships,
and carry away our oars, if possible; but when necessity obliged them to
come nearer, they had recourse, from the skill and art of the pilots, to
the valor of the mountaineers. But our men, not having such expert seamen,
or skillful pilots, for they had been hastily drafted from the merchant
ships, and were not yet acquainted even with the names of the rigging,
were moreover impeded by the heaviness and slowness of our vessels, which
having been built in a hurry and of green timber, were not so easily maneuvered.
Therefore, when Caesar's men had an opportunity of a close engagement,
they cheerfully opposed two of the enemy's ships with one of theirs. And
throwing in the grappling-irons, and holding both ships fast, they fought
on both sides of the deck, and boarded the enemy's; and having killed numbers
of the Albici and shepherds, they sank some of their ships, took others
with the men on board, and drove the rest into the harbor. That day the
Massilians lost nine ships, including those that were taken.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.59": [1.59] When news of this battle
was brought to Caesar at Ilerda, the bridge being completed at the same
time, fortune soon took a turn. The enemy, daunted by the courage of our
horse, did not scour the country as freely or as boldly as before: but
sometimes advancing a small distance from the camp, that they might have
a ready retreat, they foraged within narrower bounds: at other times, they
took a longer circuit to avoid our outposts and parties of horse; or having
sustained some loss, or descried our horse at a distance, they fled in
the midst of their expedition, leaving their baggage behind them; at length
they resolved to leave off foraging for several days, and, contrary to
the practice of all nations, to go out at night.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.60": [1.60] In the mean time the
Oscenses and the Calagurritani, who were under the government of the Oscenses,
send embassadors to Caesar, and offer to submit to his orders. They are
followed by the Tarraconenses, Jacetani, and Ausetani, and in a few days
more by the Illurgavonenses, who dwell near the river Ebro. He requires
of them all, to assist him with corn, to which they agreed, and having
collected all the cattle in the country, they convey them into his camp.
One entire cohort of the Illurgavonenses, knowing the design of their state,
came over to Caesar, from the place where they were stationed, and carried
their colors with them. A great change is shortly made in the face of affairs.
The bridge being finished, five powerful states being joined to Caesar,
a way opened for the receiving of corn, and the rumors of the assistance
of legions which were said to be on their march, with Pompey at their head,
through Mauritania, having died away, several of the more distant states
revolt from Afranius, and enter into league with Caesar.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.61": [1.61] While the spirits of
the enemy were dismayed at these things, Caesar, that he might not be always
obliged to send his horse a long circuit round by the bridge, having found
a convenient place, began to sink several drains, thirty feet deep, by
which he might draw off a part of the river Segre, and make a ford over
it. When these were almost finished, Afranius and Petreius began to be
greatly alarmed, lest they should be altogether cut off from corn and forage,
because Caesar was very strong in cavalry. They therefore resolved to quit
their posts, and to transfer the war to Celtiberia. There was, moreover,
a circumstance that confirmed them in this resolution: for of the two adverse
parties, that, which had stood by Sertorius in the late war, being conquered
by Pompey, still trembled at his name and sway, though absent: the other
which had remained firm in Pompey's interest, loved him for the favors
which they had received: but Caesar's name was not known to the barbarians.
From these they expected considerable aid, both of horse and foot, and
hoped to protract the war till winter, in a friendly country. Having come
to this resolution, they gave orders to collect all the ships in the river
Ebro, and to bring them to Octogesa, a town situated on the river Ebro,
about twenty miles distant from their camp. At this part of the river,
they ordered a bridge to be made of boats fastened together, and transported
two legions over the river Segre, and fortified their camp with a rampart,
twelve feet high.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.62": [1.62] Notice of this being
given by the scouts, Caesar continued his work day and night, with very
great fatigue to the soldiers, to drain the river, and so far effected
his purpose, that the horse were both able and bold enough, though with
some difficulty and danger, to pass the river; but the foot had only their
shoulders and upper part of their breast above the water, so that their
fording it was retarded, not only by the depth of the water, but also by
the rapidity of the current. However, almost at the same instant, news
was received of the bridge being nearly completed over the Ebro, and a
ford was found in the Segre.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.63": [1.63] Now indeed the enemy
began to think that they ought to hasten their march. Accordingly, leaving
two auxiliary cohorts in the garrison at Ilerda, they crossed the Segre
with their whole force, and formed one camp with the two legions which
they had led across a few days before. Caesar had no resource, but to annoy
and cut down their rear; since with his cavalry to go by the bridge, required
him to take a long circuit; so that they would arrive at the Ebro by a
much shorter route. The horse, which he had detached, crossed the ford,
and when Afranius and Petreius had broken up their camp about the third
watch, they suddenly appeared on their rear, and spreading round them in
great numbers, retard and impede their march.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.64": [1.64] At break of day, it
was perceived from the rising grounds which joined Caesar's camp, that
their rear was vigorously pressed by our horse; that the last line sometimes
halted and was broken; at other times, that they joined battle and that
our men were beaten back by a general charge of their cohorts, and, in
their turn, pursued them when they wheeled about: but through the whole
camp the soldiers gathered in parties, and declared their chagrin that
the enemy had been suffered to escape from their hands and that the war
had been unnecessarily protracted. They applied to their tribunes and centurions,
and entreated them to inform Caesar that he need not spare their labor
or consider their danger; that they were ready and able, and would venture
to ford the river where the horse had crossed. Caesar, encouraged by their
zeal and importunity, though he felt reluctant to expose his army to a
river so exceedingly large, yet judged it prudent to attempt it and make
a trial. Accordingly, he ordered all the weaker soldiers, whose spirit
or strength seemed unequal to the fatigue, to be selected from each century,
and left them, with one legion besides, to guard the camp: the rest of
the legions he drew out without any baggage, and, having disposed a great
number of horses in the river, above and below the ford, he led his army
over. A few of his soldiers being carried away by the force of the current,
were stopped by the horse and taken up, and not a man perished. His army
being safe on the opposite bank, he drew out his forces and resolved to
lead them forward in three battalions: and so great was the ardor of the
soldiers that, notwithstanding the addition of a circuit of six miles and
a considerable delay in fording the river, before the ninth hour of the
day they came up with those who had set out at the third watch.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.65": [1.65] When Afranius, who
was in company with Petreius, saw them at a distance, being affrighted
at so unexpected a sight, he halted on a rising ground and drew up his
army. Caesar refreshed his army on the plain that he might not expose them
to battle while fatigued; and when the enemy attempted to renew their march,
he pursued and stopped them. They were obliged to pitch their camp sooner
than they had intended, for there were mountains at a small distance; and
difficult and narrow roads awaited them about five miles off. They retired
behind these mountains that they might avoid Caesar's cavalry, and, placing
parties in the narrow roads, stop the progress of his army and lead their
own forces across the Ebro without danger or apprehension. This it was
their interest to attempt and to effect by any means possible; but, fatigued
by the skirmishes all day, and by the labor of their march, they deferred
it till the following day; Caesar likewise encamped on the next hill.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.66": [1.66] About midnight a few
of their men who had gone some distance from the camp to fetch water, being
taken by our horse, Caesar is informed by them that the generals of the
enemy were drawing their troops out of the camp without noise. Upon this
information Caesar ordered the signal to be given and the military shout
to be raised for packing up the baggage. When they heard the shout, being
afraid lest they should be stopped in the night and obliged to engage under
their baggage, or lest they should be confined in the narrow roads by Caesar's
horse, they put a stop to their march and kept their forces in their camp.
The next day Petreius went out privately with a few horse to reconnoitre
the country. A similar movement was made from Caesar's camp. Lucius Decidius
Saxa, was detached with a small party to explore the nature of the country.
Each returned with the same account to his camp, that there was a level
road for the next five miles, that there then succeeded a rough and mountainous
country. Whichever should first obtain possession of the defiles would
have no trouble in preventing the other's progress.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.67": [1.67] There was a debate
in the council between Afranius and Petreius, and the time of marching
was the subject. The majority were of opinion that they should begin their
march at night, "for they might reach the defiles before they should be
discovered." Others, because a shout had been raised the night before in
Caesar's camp, used this as an argument that they could not leave the camp
unnoticed: "that Caesar's cavalry were patrolling the whole night, and
that all the ways and roads were beset; that battles at night ought to
be avoided, because, in civil dissension, a soldier once daunted is more
apt to consult his fears than his oath; that the daylight raised a strong
sense of shame in the eyes of all, and that the presence of the tribunes
and centurions had the same effect: by these things the soldiers would
be restrained and awed to their duty. Wherefore they should, by all means,
attempt to force their way by day; for, though a trifling loss might be
sustained, yet the post which they desired might be secured with safety
to the main body of the army." This opinion prevailed in the council, and
the next day, at the dawn, they resolved to set forward.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.68": [1.68] Caesar, having taken
a view of the country, the moment the sky began to grow white, led his
forces from the camp and marched at the head of his army by a long circuit,
keeping to no regular road; for the road which led to the Ebro and Octogesa
was occupied by the enemy's camp, which lay in Caesar's way. His soldiers
were obliged to cross extensive and difficult valleys. Craggy cliffs, in
several places, interrupted their march, insomuch that their arms had to
be handed to one another, and the soldiers were forced to perform a great
part of their march unarmed, and were lifted up the rocks by each other.
But not a man murmured at the fatigue, because they imagined that there
would be a period to all their toils, if they could cut off the enemy from
the Ebro and intercept their convoys.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.69": [1.69] At first, Afranius's
soldiers ran in high spirits from their camp to look at us, and in contumelious
language upbraided us, "that we were forced, for want of necessary subsistence,
to run away, and return to Ilerda." For our route was different from what
we proposed, and we appeared to be going a contrary way. But their generals
applauded their own prudence in keeping within their camp, and it was a
strong confirmation of their opinion, that they saw we marched without
wagons or baggage, which made them confident that we could not long endure
want. But when they saw our army gradually wheel to the right, and observed
our van was already passing the line of their camp, there was nobody so
stupid, or averse to fatigue, as not to think it necessary to march from
the camp immediately, and oppose us. The cry to arms was raised, and all
the army, except a few which were left to guard the camp, set out and marched
the direct road to the Ebro.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.70": [1.70] The contest depended
entirely on dispatch, which should first get possession of the defile and
the mountains. The difficulty of the roads delayed Caesar's army, but his
cavalry pursuing Afranius's forces, retarded their march. However, the
affair was necessarily reduced to this point, with respect to Afranius's
men, that if they first gained the mountains, which they desired, they
would themselves avoid all danger, but could not save the baggage of their
whole army, nor the cohorts which they had left behind in the camps, to
which, being intercepted by Caesar's army, by no means could assistance
be given. Caesar first accomplished the march, and having found a plain
behind large rocks, drew up his army there in order of battle and facing
the enemy. Afranius, perceiving that his rear was galled by our cavalry,
and seeing the enemy before him, having come to a hill, made a halt on
it. Thence he detached four cohorts of Spanish light infantry to the highest
mountain which was in view: to this he ordered them to hasten with all
expedition, and to take possession of it, with the intention of going to
the same place with all his forces, then altering his route, and crossing
the hills to Octogesa. As the Spaniards were making toward it in an oblique
direction, Caesar's horse espied them and attacked them, nor were they
able to withstand the charge of the cavalry even for a moment, but were
all surrounded and cut to pieces in the sight of the two armies.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.71": [1.71] There was now an opportunity
for managing affairs successfully, nor did it escape Caesar, that an army
daunted at suffering such a loss before their eyes, could not stand, especially
as they were surrounded by our horse, and the engagement would take place
on even and open ground. To this he was importuned on all sides. The lieutenants,
centurions, and tribunes, gathered round him, and begged "that he would
not hesitate to begin the battle: that the hearts of all the soldiers were
very anxious for it: that Afranius's men had by several circumstances betrayed
signs of fear; in that they had not assisted their party; in that they
had not quitted the hill; in that they did not sustain the charge of our
cavalry, but crowding their standards into one place, did not observe either
rank or order. But if he had any apprehensions from the disadvantage of
the ground, that an opportunity would be given him of coming to battle
in some other place: for that Afranius must certainly come down, and would
not be able to remain there for want of water."
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.72": [1.72] Caesar had conceived
hopes of ending the affair without an engagement, or without striking a
blow, because he had cut off the enemy's supplies. Why should he hazard
the loss of any of his men, even in a successful battle? Why should he
expose soldiers to be wounded, who had deserved so well of him? Why, in
short, should he tempt fortune? especially when it was as much a general's
duty to conquer by tactics as by the sword. Besides, he was moved with
compassion for those citizens, who, he foresaw, must fall: and he had rather
gain his object without any loss or injury to them. This resolution of
Caesar was not generally approved of; but the soldiers openly declared
to each other that since such an opportunity of victory was let pass, they
would not come to an engagement, even when Caesar should wish it. He persevered
however in his resolution, and retired a little from that place to abate
the enemy's fears. Petreius and Afranius, having got this opportunity,
retired to their camp. Caesar, having disposed parties on the mountains,
and cut off all access to the Ebro, fortified his camp as close to the
enemy as he could.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.73": [1.73] The day following,
the generals of his opponents, being alarmed that they had lost all prospect
of supplies, and of access to the Ebro, consulted as to what other course
they should take. There were two roads, one to Ilerda, if they chose to
return, the other to Tarraco, if they should march to it. While they were
deliberating on these matters, intelligence was brought them that their
watering parties were attacked by our horse: upon which information, they
dispose several parties of horse and auxiliary foot along the road, and
intermix some legionary cohorts, and begin to throw up a rampart from the
camp to the water, that they might be able to procure water within their
lines, both without fear, and without a guard. Petreius and Afranius divided
this task between themselves, and went in person to some distance from
their camp for the purpose of seeing it accomplished.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.74": [1.74] The soldiers having
obtained by their absence a free opportunity of conversing with each other,
came out in great numbers, and inquired each for whatever acquaintance
or fellow-citizen he had in our camp, and invited him to him. First they
returned them general thanks for sparing them the day before, when they
were greatly terrified, and acknowledged that they were alive through their
kindness; then they inquired about the honor of our general, and whether
they could with safety intrust themselves to him; and declared their sorrow
that they had not done so in the beginning, and that they had taken up
arms against their relations and kinsmen. Encouraged by these conferences,
they desired the general's parole for the lives of Petreius and Afranius,
that they might not appear guilty of a crime, in having betrayed their
generals. When they were assured of obtaining their demands, they promised
that they would immediately remove their standards, and sent centurions
of the first rank as deputies to treat with Caesar about a peace. In the
mean time some of them invite their acquaintances, and bring them to their
camp, others are brought away by their friends, so that the two camps seemed
to be united into one, and several of the tribunes and centurions came
to Caesar, and paid their respects to him. The same was done by some of
the nobility of Spain, whom they summoned to their assistance, and kept
in their camp as hostages. They inquired after their acquaintance and friends,
by whom each might have the means of being recommended to Caesar. Even
Afranius's son, a young man, endeavored, by means of Sulpitius the lieutenant,
to make terms for his own and his father's life. Every place was filled
with mirth and congratulations; in the one army, because they thought they
had escaped so impending danger; in the other, because they thought they
had completed so important a matter without blows; and Caesar, in every
man's judgment, reaped the advantage of his former lenity, and his conduct
was applauded by all.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.75": [1.75] When these circumstances
were announced to Afranius, he left the work which he had begun, and returned
to his camp, determined as it appeared, whatever should be the event, to
bear it with an even and steady mind. Petreius did not neglect himself;
he armed his domestics; with them and the praetorian cohort of Spaniards,
and a few foreign horse, his dependents, whom he commonly kept near him
to guard his person, he suddenly flew to the rampart, interrupted the conferences
of the soldiers, drove our men from the camp, and put to death as many
as he caught. The rest formed into a body, and being alarmed by the unexpected
danger, wrapped their left arms in their cloaks, and drew their swords,
and in this manner, depending on the nearness of their camp, defended themselves
against the Spaniards, and the horse, and made good their retreat to the
camp, where they were protected by the cohorts which were on guard.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.76": [1.76] Petreius, after accomplishing
this, went round every maniple, calling the soldiers by their names, and
entreating with tears that they would not give up him and their absent
general Pompey, as a sacrifice to the vengeance of their enemies. Immediately
they ran in crowds to the general's pavilion, when he required them all
to take an oath that they would not desert nor betray the army nor the
generals, nor form any design distinct from the general interest. He himself
swore first to the tenor of those words, and obliged Afranius to take the
same oath. The tribunes and centurions followed their example; the soldiers
were brought out by centuries, and took the same oath. They gave orders,
that whoever had any of Caesar's soldiers should produce them; as soon
as they were produced, they put them to death publicly in the praetorium,
but most of them concealed those that they had entertained, and let them
out at night over the rampart. Thus the terror raised by the generals,
the cruelty of the punishments, the new obligation of an oath, removed
all hopes of surrender for the present, changed the soldiers' minds, and
reduced matters to the former state of war.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.77": [1.77] Caesar ordered the
enemy's soldiers, who had come into his camp to hold a conference, to be
searched for with the strictest diligence, and sent back. But of the tribunes
and centurions, several voluntarily remained with him, and he afterward
treated them with great respect. The centurions he promoted to higher ranks,
and conferred on the Roman knights the honor of tribunes.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.78": [1.78] Afranius's men were
distressed in foraging, and procured water with difficulty. The legionary
soldiers had a tolerable supply of corn, because they had beef ordered
to bring from Ilerda sufficient to last twenty-two days; the Spanish and
auxiliary forces had none, for they had but few opportunities of procuring
any, and their bodies were not accustomed to bear burdens; and therefore
a great number of them came over to Caesar every day. Their affairs were
under these difficulties; but of the two schemes proposed, the most expedient
seemed to be to return to Ilerda, because they had left some corn there;
and there they hoped to decide on a plan for their future conduct. Tarraco
lay at a greater distance; and in such a space they knew affairs might
admit of many changes. Their design having met with approbation, they set
out from their camp. Caesar having sent forward his cavalry, to annoy and
retard their rear, followed close after with his legions. Not a moment
passed in which their rear was not engaged with our horse.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.79": [1.79] Their manner of fighting
was this: the light cohorts closed their rear, and frequently made a stand
on the level grounds. If they had a mountain to ascend, the very nature
of the place readily secured them from any danger; for the advanced guards,
from the rising grounds, protected the rest in their ascent. When they
approached a valley or declivity, and the advanced men could not impart
assistance to the tardy, our horse threw their darts at them from the rising
grounds with advantage; then their affairs were in a perilous situation;
the only plan left was, that whenever they came near such places, they
should give orders to the legions to halt, and by a violent effort repulse
our horse; and these being forced to give way, they should suddenly, with
the utmost speed, run all together down to the valley, and having passed
it, should face about again on the next hill. For so far were they from
deriving any assistance from their horse (of which they had a large number),
that they were obliged to receive them into the center of their army, and
themselves protect them, as they were daunted by former battles. And on
their march no one could quit the line without being taken by Caesar's
horse.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.80": [1.80] While skirmishes were
fought in this manner, they advanced but slowly and gradually, and frequently
halted to help their rear, as then happened. For having advanced four miles,
and being very much harassed by our horse, they took post on a high mountain,
and there in trenched themselves on the front only, facing the enemy; and
did not take their baggage off their cattle. When they perceived that Caesar's
camp was pitched, and the tents fixed up, and his horse sent out to forage,
they suddenly rushed out about twelve o'clock the same day, and, having
hopes that we should be delayed by the absence of our horse, they began
to march, which Caesar perceiving, followed them with the legions that
remained. He left a few cohorts to guard his baggage, and ordered the foragers
to be called home at the tenth hour, and the horse to follow him. The horse
shortly returned to their daily duty on march, and charged the rear so
vigorously, that they almost forced them to fly; and several privates and
some centurions were killed. The main body of Caesar's army was at hand,
and universal ruin threatened them.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.81": [1.81] Then indeed, not having
opportunity either to choose a convenient position for their camp, or to
march forward, they were obliged to halt, and to encamp at a distance from
water, and on ground naturally unfavorable. But for the reasons already
given, Caesar did not attack them, nor suffer a tent to be pitched that
day, that his men might be the readier to pursue them whether they attempted
to run off by night or by day. Observing the defect in their position,
they spent the whole night in extending their work, and turning their camp
to ours. The next day, at dawn, they do the same, and spend the whole day
in that manner, but in proportion as they advanced their works, and extended
their camp, they were further distant from the water; and one evil was
remedied by another. The first night, no one went out for water. The next
day, they left a guard in the camp, and led out all their forces to water:
but not a person was sent to look for forage. Caesar was more desirous
that they should be humbled by these means, and forced to come to terms,
than decide the contest by battle. Yet he endeavored to surround them with
a wall and trench, that he might be able to check their most sudden sally,
to which he imagined that they must have recourse. Hereupon, urged by want
of fodder, that they might be the readier for a march, they killed all
their baggage cattle.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.82": [1.82] In this work, and the
deliberations on it, two days were spent. By the third day a considerable
part of Caesar's work was finished. To interrupt his progress, they drew
out their legions about the eighth hour, by a certain signal, and placed
them in order of battle before their camp. Caesar calling his legions off
from their work, and ordering the horse to hold themselves in readiness,
marshaled his army: for to appear to decline an engagement contrary to
the opinion of the soldiers and the general voice, would have been attended
with great disadvantage. But for the reasons already known, he was dissuaded
from wishing to engage, and the more especially, because the short space
between the camps, even if the enemy were put to flight, would not contribute
much to a decisive victory; for the two camps were not distant from each
other above two thousand feet. Two parts of this were occupied by the armies,
and one third left for the soldiers to charge and make their attack. If
a battle should be begun, the nearness of the camps would afford a ready
retreat to the conquered party in the flight. For this reason Caesar had
resolved to make resistance if they attacked him, but not to be the first
to provoke the battle.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.83": [1.83] Afranius's five legions
were drawn up in two lines, the auxiliary cohorts formed the third line,
and acted as reserves. Caesar had three lines, four cohorts out of each
of the five legions formed the first line. Three more from each legion
followed them, as reserves: and three others were behind these. The slingers
and archers were stationed in the center of the line; the cavalry closed
the flanks. The hostile armies being arranged in this manner, each seemed
determined to adhere to his first intention: Caesar not to hazard a battle,
unless forced to it; Afranius to interrupt Caesar's works. However, the
matter was deferred, and both armies kept under arms till sunset; when
they both returned to their camp. The next day Caesar prepared to finish
the works which he had begun. The enemy attempted to pass the river Segre
by a ford. Caesar, having perceived this, sent some light armed Germans
and a party of horse across the river, and disposed several parties along
the banks to guard them.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.84": [1.84] At length, beset on
all sides, their cattle having been four days without fodder, and having
no water, wood, or corn, they beg a conference; and that, if possible,
in a place remote from the soldiers. When this was refused by Caesar, but
a public interview offered if they chose it, Afranius's son was given as
a hostage to Caesar. They met in the place appointed by Caesar. In the
hearing of both armies Afranius spoke thus: "That Caesar ought not to be
displeased either with him or his soldiers, for wishing to preserve their
attachment to their general, Cneius Pompey. That they had now sufficiently
discharged their duty to him, and had suffered punishment enough, in having
endured the want of every necessary: but now, pent up almost like wild
beasts, they were prevented from procuring water, and prevented from walking
abroad; and were not able to bear the bodily pain or the mental disgrace:
but confessed themselves vanquished: and begged and entreated, if there
was any room left for mercy, that they should not be necessitated to suffer
the most severe penalties." These sentiments were delivered in the most
submissive and humble language.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.85": [1.85] Caesar replied, "That
either to complain or sue for mercy became no man less than him: for that
every other person had done their duty: himself, in having declined to
engage on favorable terms, in an advantageous situation and time, that
all things tending to a peace might be totally unembarrassed: his army,
in having preserved and protected the men whom they had in their power,
notwithstanding the injuries which they had received, and the murder of
their comrades; and even Afranius's soldiers, who of themselves treated
about concluding a peace, by which they thought that they would secure
the lives of all. Thus, that the parties on both sides inclined to mercy:
that the generals only were averse to peace: that they paid no regard to
the laws either of conference or truce; and had most inhumanly put to death
ignorant persons, who were deceived by a conference: that therefore, they
had met that fate which usually befalls men from excessive obstinacy and
arrogance; and were obliged to have recourse, and most earnestly desire
that which they had shortly before disdained. That for his part, he would
not avail himself of their present humiliation, or his present advantage,
to require terms by which his power might be increased, but only that those
armies, which they had maintained for so many years to oppose him, should
be disbanded: for six legions had been sent into Spain, and a seventh raised
there, and many and powerful fleets provided, and generals of great military
experience sent to command them, for no other purpose than to oppose him:
that none of these measures were adopted to keep the Spains in peace, or
for the use of the province, which, from the length of the peace, stood
in need of no such aid; that all these things were long since designed
against him; that against him a new sort of government was established,
that the same person should be at the gates of Rome, to direct the affairs
of the city; and though absent, have the government of two most warlike
provinces for so many years: that against him the laws of the magistrates
had been altered; that the late praetors and consuls should not be sent
to govern the provinces as had been the constant custom, but persons approved
of and chosen by a faction. That against him the excuse of age was not
admitted; but persons of tried experience in former wars were called up
to take the command of the armies: that with respect to him only, the routine
was not observed which had been allowed to all generals, that, after a
successful war, they should return home and disband their armies, if not
with some mark of honor, at least without disgrace; that he had submitted
to all these things patiently, and would still submit to them; nor did
he now desire to take their army from them and keep it to himself (which,
however, would not be a difficult matter), but only that they should not
have it to employ against him: and therefore, as he said before, let them
quit the provinces, and disband their army. If this was complied with,
he would injure no person; that these were the last and only conditions
of peace."
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.86": [1.86] It was very acceptable
and agreeable to Afranius's soldiers, as might be easily known from their
signs of joy, that they who expected some injury after this defeat, should
obtain without solicitation the reward of a dismissal. For when a debate
was introduced about the place and time of their dismissal, they all began
to express, both by words and signs, from the rampart where they stood,
that they should be discharged immediately; for although every security
might be given, that they would be disbanded, still the matter would be
uncertain, if it was deferred to a future day. After a short debate on
either side, it was brought to this issue: that those who had any settlement
or possession in Spain, should be immediately discharged: the rest at the
river Var. Caesar gave security that they should receive no damage, and
that no person should be obliged against his inclination to take the military
oath under him.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.1.87": [1.87] Caesar promised to
supply them with corn from the present time till they arrived at the river
Var. He further adds, that whatever any of them lost in the war, which
was in the possession of his soldiers, should be restored to those that
lost them. To his soldiers he made a recompense in money for those things,
a just valuation being made. Whatever disputes Afranius's soldiers had
afterward among themselves, they voluntarily submitted to Caesar's decision.
Afranius and Petreius, when pay was demanded by the legions, a sedition
almost breaking out, asserted that the time had not yet come, and required
that Caesar should take cognizance of it; and both parties were content
with his decision. About a third part of their army being dismissed in
two days, Caesar ordered two of his legions, to go before, the rest to
follow the vanquished enemy; that they should encamp at a small distance
from each other. The execution of this business he gave in charge to Quintus
Fufius Kalenus, one of his lieutenants. According to his directions, they
marched from Spain to the river Var, and there the rest of the army was
disbanded.
