<p align="justify"> 53 B.C.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.1": [6.1] Caesar, expecting for many reasons
a greater commotion in Gaul, resolves to hold a levy by the means of M.
Silanus C. Antistius
Reginus, and T. Sextius, his lieutenants: at the same time he requested
Cn. Pompey, the proconsul, that since he was remaining near the city invested
with
military command for the interests of the commonwealth, he would command
those men whom when consul he had levied by the military oath in Cisalpine
Gaul, to join their respective corps, and to proceed to him; thinking
it of great importance, as far as regarded the opinion which the Gauls
would entertain
for the future, that that the resources of Italy should appear so great
that if any loss should be sustained in war, not only could it be repaired
in a short time,
but likewise be further supplied by still larger forces. And when Pompey
had granted this to the interests of the commonwealth and the claims of
friendship, Caesar having quickly completed the levy by means of his
lieutenants, after three regiments had been both formed and brought to
him before
the winter [had] expired, and the number of those cohorts which he
had lost under Q. Titurius had been doubled, taught the Gauls, both by
his dispatch
and by his forces what the discipline and the power of the Roman people
could accomplish.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.2": [6.2] Indutiomarus having been slain,
as we have stated, the government was conferred upon his relatives by the
Treviri. They cease not
to importune the neighboring Germans and to promise them money: when
they could not obtain [their object] from those nearest them, they try
those more
remote. Having found some states willing to accede to their wishes,
they enter into a compact with them by a mutual oath, and give hostages
as a security
for the money: they attach Ambiorix to them by an alliance and confederacy.
Caesar, on being informed of their acts, since he saw that war was being
prepared on all sides, that the Nervii, Aduatuci, and Menapii, with
the addition of all the Germans on this side of the Rhine were under arms,
that the
Senones did not assemble according to his command, and were concerting
measures with the Carnutes and the neighboring states, that the Germans
were
importuned by the Treviri in frequent embassies, thought that he ought
to take measures for the war earlier [than usual].
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.3": [6.3] Accordingly, while the winter
was not yet ended, having concentrated the four nearest legions, he marched
unexpectedly into the
territories of the Nervii, and before they could either assemble or
retreat, after capturing a large number of cattle and of men, and wasting
their lands and
giving up that booty to the soldiers, compelled them to enter into
a surrender and give him hostages. That business having been speedily executed,
he again
led his legions back into winter-quarters. Having proclaimed a council
of Gaul in the beginning of the spring, as he had been accustomed [to do],
when the
deputies from the rest, except the Senones, the Carnutes, and the Treviri,
had come, judging this to be the commencement of war and revolt, that he
might
appear to consider all things of less consequence [than that war],
he transfers the council to Lutetia of the Parisii. These were adjacent
to the Senones, and
had united their state to them during the memory of their fathers,
but were thought to have no part in the present plot. Having proclaimed
this from the
tribunal, he advances the same day toward the Senones with his legions,
and arrives among them by long marches.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.4": [6.4] Acco, who had been the author
of that enterprise, on being informed of his arrival, orders the people
to assemble in the towns; to
them, while attempting this, and before it could be accomplished, news
is brought that the Romans are close at hand: through necessity they give
over their
design and send embassadors to Caesar for the purpose of imploring
pardon; they make advances to him through the Aedui, whose state was from
ancient times under the protection of Rome. Caesar readily grants them
pardon, and receives their excuse, at the request of the Aedui, because
he thought
that the summer season was one for an impending war, not for an investigation.
Having imposed one hundred hostages, he delivers these to the Aedui to
be held in charge by them. To the same place the Carnutes send embassadors
and hostages, employing as their mediators the Remi, under whose
protection they were: they receive the same answers. Caesar concludes
the council and imposes a levy of cavalry on the states.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.5": [6.5] This part of Gaul having been
tranquilized, he applies himself entirely both in mind and soul to the
war with the Treviri and
Ambiorix. He orders Cavarinus to march with him with the cavalry of
the Senones, lest any commotion should arise either out of his hot temper,
or out of
the hatred of the state which he had incurred. After arranging these
things, as he considered it certain that Ambiorix would not contend in
battle, he
watched his other plans attentively. The Menapii bordered on the territories
of the Eburones, and were protected by one continued extent of morasses
and woods; and they alone out of Gaul had never sent embassadors to
Caesar on the subject of peace. Caesar knew that a tie of hospitality subsisted
between them and Ambiorix: he also discovered that the latter had entered
into an alliance with the Germans by means of the Treviri. Ho thought that
these auxiliaries ought to be detached from him before he provoked
him to war; lest he, despairing of safety, should either proceed to conceal
himself in
the territories of the Menapii, or should be driven to coalesce with
the Germans beyond the Rhine. Having entered upon this resolution, he sends
the
baggage of the whole army to Labienus, in the territories of the Treviri
and orders two legions to proceed to him: he himself proceeds against the
Menapii
with five lightly-equipped legions. They, having assembled no troops,
as they relied on the defense of their position, retreat into the woods
and morasses,
and convey thither all their property.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.6": [6.6] Caesar, having divided his forces
with C. Fabius, his lieutenant, and M. Crassus his questor, and having
hastily constructed some
bridges, enters their country in three divisions, burns their houses
and villages, and gets possession of a large number of cattle and men.
Constrained by
these circumstances the Menapii send embassadors to him for the purpose
of suing for peace. He, after receiving hostages, assures them that he
will
consider them in the number of his enemies if they shall receive within
their territories either Ambiorix or his embassadors. Having determinately
settled
these things, he left among the Menapii, Commius the Atrebatian, with
some cavalry as a guard; he himself proceeds toward the Treviri.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.7": [6.7] While these things are being
performed by Caesar, the Treviri, having drawn together large forces of
infantry and cavalry, were
preparing to attack Labienus and the legion which was wintering in
their territories, and were already not further distant from him than a
journey of two
days, when they learn that two legions had arrived by the order of
Caesar. Having pitched their camp fifteen miles off, they resolve to await
the support of
the Germans. Labienus, having learned the design of the enemy, hoping
that through their rashness there would be some opportunity of engaging,
after
leaving a guard of five cohorts for the baggage, advances against the
enemy with twenty-five cohorts and a large body of cavalry, and, leaving
the space of
a mile between them, fortifies his camp. There was between Labienus
and the enemy a river difficult to cross, and with steep banks: this neither
did he
himself design to cross, nor did he suppose the enemy would cross it.
Their hope of auxiliaries was daily increasing. He [Labienus] openly says
in a council
that "since the Germans are said to be approaching, he would not bring
into uncertainty his own and the army's fortunes, and the next day would
move his
camp at early dawn." These words are quickly carried to the enemy,
since out of so large a number of cavalry composed of Gauls, nature compelled
some to favor the Gallic interests. Labienus, having assembled the
tribunes of the soldiers and principal centurions by night, states what
his design is, and,
that he may the more easily give the enemy a belief of his fears, he
orders the camp to be moved with greater noise and confusion than was usual
with the
Roman people. By these means he makes his departure [appear] like a
retreat. These things, also, since the camps were so near, are reported
to the
enemy by scouts before daylight.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.8": [6.8] Scarcely had the rear advanced
beyond the fortifications when the Gauls, encouraging one another "not
to cast from their hands
the anticipated booty, that it was a tedious thing, while the Romans
were panic-stricken, to be waiting for the aid of the Germans, and that
their dignity did
not suffer them to fear to attack with such great forces so small a
band, particularly when retreating and encumbered," do not hesitate to
cross the river
and give battle in a disadvantageous position. Labienus suspecting
that these things would happen, was proceeding quietly, and using the same
pretense of
a march, in order that he might entice them across the river. Then,
having sent forward the baggage some short distance and placed it on a
certain
eminence, he says, "Soldiers, you have the opportunity you have sought:
you hold the enemy in an encumbered and disadvantageous position: display
to
us, your leaders, the same valor you have ofttimes displayed to your
general: imagine that he is present and actually sees these exploits."
At the same time
he orders the troops to face about toward the enemy and form in line
of battle, and, dispatching a few troops of cavalry as a guard for the
baggage, he
places the rest of the horse on the wings. Our men, raising a shout,
quickly throw their javelins at the enemy. They, when, contrary to their
expectation,
they saw those whom they believed to be retreating, advance toward
them with threatening banners, were not able to sustain even the charge,
and, being
put to flight at the first onslaught, sought the nearest woods; Labienus
pursuing them with the cavalry, upon a large number being slain, and several
taken
prisoners, got possession of the state a few days after; for the Germans,
who were coming to the aid of the Treviri, having been informed of their
flight,
retreated to their homes. The relations of Indutiomarus, who had been
the promoters of the revolt, accompanying them, quitted their own state
with them.
The supreme power and government were delivered to Cingetorix, whom
we have stated to have remained firm in his allegiance from the commencement.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.9": [6.9] Caesar, after he came from the
territories of the Menapii into those of the Treviri, resolved for two
reasons to cross the Rhine;
one of which was, because they had sent assistance to the Treviri against
him; the other, that Ambiorix might not have a retreat among them. Having
determined on these matters, he began to build a bridge a little above
that place where he had before conveyed over his army. The plan having
been
known and laid down, the work is accomplished in a few days by the
great exertion of the soldiers. Having left a strong guard at the bridge
on the side of
the Treviri, lest any commotion should suddenly arise among them, he
leads over the rest of the forces and the cavalry. The Ubii, who before
had sent
hostages and come to a capitulation, send embassadors to him, for the
purpose of vindicating themselves, to assure him that "neither had auxiliaries
been
sent to the Treviri from their state, nor had they violated their allegiance;"
they entreat and beseech him "to spare them, lest, in his common hatred
of the
Germans, the innocent should suffer the penalty of the guilty: they
promise to give more hostages, if he desire them." Having investigated
the case, Caesar
finds that the auxiliaries had been sent by the Suevi; he accepts the
apology of the Ubii, and makes the minute inquiries concerning the approaches
and the
routes to the territories of the Suevi.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.10": [6.10] In the mean time he is informed
by the Ubii, a few days after, that the Suevi are drawing all their forces
into one place, and are
giving orders to those nations which are under their government to
send auxiliaries of infantry and of cavalry. Having learned these things,
he provides a
supply of corn, selects a proper place for his camp, and commands the
Ubii to drive off their cattle and carry away all their possessions from
the country
parts into the towns, hoping that they, being a barbarous and ignorant
people, when harassed by the want of provisions, might be brought to an
engagement on disadvantageous terms: he orders them to send numerous
scouts among the Suevi, and learn what things are going on among them.
They
execute the orders, and, a few days having intervened, report that
all the Suevi, after certain intelligence concerning the army of the Romans
had come,
retreated with all their own forces and those of their allies, which
they had assembled, to the utmost extremities of their territories: that
there is a wood
there of very great extent, which is called Bacenis; that this stretches
a great way into the interior, and, being opposed as a natural barrier,
defends from
injuries and incursions the Cherusci against the Suevi, and the Suevi
against the Cherusci: that at the entrance of that forest the Suevi had
determined to
await the coming up of the Romans.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.11": [6.11] Since we have come to the
place, it does not appear to be foreign to our subject to lay before the
reader an account of the
manners of Gaul and Germany, and wherein these nations differ from
each other. In Gaul there are factions not only in all the states, and
in all the cantons
and their divisions, but almost in each family, and of these factions
those are the leaders who are considered according to their judgment to
possess the
greatest influence, upon whose will and determination the management
of all affairs and measures depends. And that seems to have been instituted
in
ancient times with this view, that no one of the common people should
be in want of support against one more powerful; for, none [of those leaders]
suffers his party to be oppressed and defrauded, and if he do otherwise,
he has no influence among his party. This same policy exists throughout
the whole
of Gaul; for all the states are divided into two factions.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.12": [6.12] When Caesar arrived in Gaul,
the Aedui were the leaders of one faction, the Sequani of the other. Since
the latter were less
powerful by themselves, inasmuch as the chief influence was from of
old among the Aedui, and their dependencies were great, they had united
to
themselves the Germans and Ariovistus, and had brought them over to
their party by great sacrifices and promises. And having fought several
successful
battles and slain all the nobility of the Aedui, they had so far surpassed
them in power, that they brought over, from the Aedui to themselves, a
large
portion of their dependents and received from them the sons of their
leading men as hostages, and compelled them to swear in their public character
that
they would enter into no design against them; and held a portion of
the neighboring land, seized on by force, and possessed the sovereignty
of the whole of
Gaul. Divitiacus urged by this necessity, had proceeded to Rome to
the senate, for the purpose of entreating assistance, and had returned
without
accomplishing his object. A change of affairs ensued on the arrival
of Caesar, the hostages were returned to the Aedui, their old dependencies
restored,
and new acquired through Caesar (because those who had attached themselves
to their alliance saw that they enjoyed a better state and a milder
government), their other interests, their influence, their reputation
were likewise increased, and in consequence, the Sequani lost the sovereignty.
The Remi
succeeded to their place, and, as it was perceived that they equaled
the Aedui in favor with Caesar, those, who on account of their old animosities
could
by no means coalesce with the Aedui, consigned themselves in clientship
to the Remi. The latter carefully protected them. Thus they possessed both
a new
and suddenly acquired influence. Affairs were then in that position
that the Aedui were considered by far the leading people, and the Remi
held the second
post of honor.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.13": [6.13] Throughout all Gaul there
are two orders of those men who are of any rank and dignity: for the commonality
is held almost in
the condition of slaves, and dares to undertake nothing of itself,
and is admitted to no deliberation. The greater part, when they are pressed
either by debt,
or the large amount of their tributes, or the oppression of the more
powerful, give themselves up in vassalage to the nobles, who possess over
them the
same rights without exception as masters over their slaves. But of
these two orders, one is that of the Druids, the other that of the knights.
The former are
engaged in things sacred, conduct the public and the private sacrifices,
and interpret all matters of religion. To these a large number of the young
men
resort for the purpose of instruction, and they [the Druids] are in
great honor among them. For they determine respecting almost all controversies,
public
and private; and if any crime has been perpetrated, if murder has been
committed, if there be any dispute about an inheritance, if any about boundaries,
these same persons decide it; they decree rewards and punishments;
if any one, either in a private or public capacity, has not submitted to
their decision,
they interdict him from the sacrifices. This among them is the most
heavy punishment. Those who have been thus interdicted are esteemed in
the number of
the impious and the criminal: all shun them, and avoid their society
and conversation, lest they receive some evil from their contact; nor is
justice
administered to them when seeking it, nor is any dignity bestowed on
them. Over all these Druids one presides, who possesses supreme authority
among
them. Upon his death, if any individual among the rest is pre-eminent
in dignity, he succeeds; but, if there are many equal, the election is
made by the
suffrages of the Druids; sometimes they even contend for the presidency
with arms. These assemble at a fixed period of the year in a consecrated
place in
the territories of the Carnutes, which is reckoned the central region
of the whole of Gaul. Hither all, who have disputes, assemble from every
part, and
submit to their decrees and determinations. This institution is supposed
to have been devised in Britain, and to have been brought over from it
into Gaul;
and now those who desire to gain a more accurate knowledge of that
system generally proceed thither for the purpose of studying it.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.14": [6.14] The Druids do not go to war,
nor pay tribute together with the rest; they have an exemption from military
service and a
dispensation in all matters. Induced by such great advantages, many
embrace this profession of their own accord, and [many] are sent to it
by their parents
and relations. They are said there to learn by heart a great number
of verses; accordingly some remain in the course of training twenty years.
Nor do they
regard it lawful to commit these to writing, though in almost all other
matters, in their public and private transactions, they use Greek characters.
That
practice they seem to me to have adopted for two reasons; because they
neither desire their doctrines to be divulged among the mass of the people,
nor
those who learn, to devote themselves the less to the efforts of memory,
relying on writing; since it generally occurs to most men, that, in their
dependence
on writing, they relax their diligence in learning thoroughly, and
their employment of the memory. They wish to inculcate this as one of their
leading tenets,
that souls do not become extinct, but pass after death from one body
to another, and they think that men by this tenet are in a great degree
excited to
valor, the fear of death being disregarded. They likewise discuss and
impart to the youth many things respecting the stars and their motion,
respecting the
extent of the world and of our earth, respecting the nature of things,
respecting the power and the majesty of the immortal gods.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.15": [6.15] The other order is that of
the knights. These, when there is occasion and any war occurs (which before
Caesar's arrival was for
the most part wont to happen every year, as either they on their part
were inflecting injuries or repelling those which others inflected on them),
are all
engaged in war. And those of them most distinguished by birth and resources,
have the greatest number of vassals and dependents about them. They
acknowledge this sort of influence and power only.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.16": [6.16] The nation of all the Gauls
is extremely devoted to superstitious rites; and on that account they who
are troubled with unusually
severe diseases, and they who are engaged in battles and dangers, either
sacrifice men as victims, or vow that they will sacrifice them, and employ
the
Druids as the performers of those sacrifices; because they think that
unless the life of a man be offered for the life of a man, the mind of
the immortal gods
can not be rendered propitious, and they have sacrifices of that kind
ordained for national purposes. Others have figures of vast size, the limbs
of which
formed of osiers they fill with living men, which being set on fire,
the men perish enveloped in the flames. They consider that the oblation
of such as have
been taken in theft, or in robbery, or any other offense, is more acceptable
to the immortal gods; but when a supply of that class is wanting, they
have
recourse to the oblation of even the innocent.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.17": [6.17] They worship as their divinity,
Mercury in particular, and have many images of him, and regard him as the
inventor of all arts,
they consider him the guide of their journeys and marches, and believe
him to have great influence over the acquisition of gain and mercantile
transactions.
Next to him they worship Apollo, and Mars, and Jupiter, and Minerva;
respecting these deities they have for the most part the same belief as
other
nations: that Apollo averts diseases, that Minerva imparts the invention
of manufactures, that Jupiter possesses the sovereignty of the heavenly
powers;
that Mars presides over wars. To him, when they have determined to
engage in battle, they commonly vow those things which they shall take
in war.
When they have conquered, they sacrifice whatever captured animals
may have survived the conflict, and collect the other things into one place.
In many
states you may see piles of these things heaped up in their consecrated
spots; nor does it often happen that any one, disregarding the sanctity
of the case,
dares either to secrete in his house things captured, or take away
those deposited; and the most severe punishment, with torture, has been
established for
such a deed.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.18": [6.18] All the Gauls assert that
they are descended from the god Dis, and say that this tradition has been
handed down by the Druids.
For that reason they compute the divisions of every season, not by
the number of days, but of nights; they keep birthdays and the beginnings
of months
and years in such an order that the day follows the night. Among the
other usages of their life, they differ in this from almost all other nations,
that they do
not permit their children to approach them openly until they are grown
up so as to be able to bear the service of war; and they regard it as indecorous
for
a son of boyish age to stand in public in the presence of his father.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.19": [6.19] Whatever sums of money the
husbands have received in the name of dowry from their wives, making an
estimate of it, they add
the same amount out of their own estates. An account is kept of all
this money conjointly, and the profits are laid by: whichever of them shall
have survived
[the other], to that one the portion of both reverts together with
the profits of the previous time. Husbands have power of life and death
over their wives as
well as over their children: and when the father of a family, born
in a more than commonly distinguished rank, has died, his relations assemble,
and, if the
circumstances of his death are suspicious, hold an investigation upon
the wives in the manner adopted toward slaves; and, if proof be obtained,
put them
to severe torture, and kill them. Their funerals, considering the state
of civilization among the Gauls, are magnificent and costly; and they cast
into the fire
all things, including living creatures, which they suppose to have
been dear to them when alive; and, a little before this period, slaves
and dependents, who
were ascertained to have been beloved by them, were, after the regular
funeral rites were completed, burnt together with them.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.20": [6.20] Those states which are considered
to conduct their commonwealth more judiciously, have it ordained by their
laws, that, if any
person shall have heard by rumor and report from his neighbors any
thing concerning the commonwealth, he shall convey it to the magistrate,
and not
impart it to any other; because it has been discovered that inconsiderate
and inexperienced men were often alarmed by false reports, and driven to
some
rash act, or else took hasty measures in affairs of the highest importance.
The magistrates conceal those things which require to be kept unknown;
and
they disclose to the people whatever they determine to be expedient.
It is not lawful to speak of the commonwealth, except in council.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.21": [6.21] The Germans differ much from
these usages, for they have neither Druids to preside over sacred offices,
nor do they pay great
regard to sacrifices. They rank in the number of the gods those alone
whom they behold, and by whose instrumentality they are obviously benefited,
namely, the sun, fire, and the moon; they have not heard of the other
deities even by report. Their whole life is occupied in hunting and in
the pursuits of the
military art; from childhood they devote themselves to fatigue and
hardships. Those who have remained chaste for the longest time, receive
the greatest
commendation among their people; they think that by this the growth
is promoted, by this the physical powers are increased and the sinews are
strengthened. And to have had knowledge of a woman before the twentieth
year they reckon among the most disgraceful acts; of which matter there
is no
concealment, because they bathe promiscuously in the rivers and [only]
use skins or small cloaks of deer's hides, a large portion of the body
being in
consequence naked.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.22": [6.22] They do not pay much attention
to agriculture, and a large portion of their food consists in milk, cheese,
and flesh; nor has any
one a fixed quantity of land or his own individual limits; but the
magistrates and the leading men each year apportion to the tribes and families,
who have
united together, as much land as, and in the place in which, they think
proper, and the year after compel them to remove elsewhere. For this enactment
they advance many reasons-lest seduced by long-continued custom, they
may exchange their ardor in the waging of war for agriculture; lest they
may be
anxious to acquire extensive estates, and the more powerful drive the
weaker from their possessions; lest they construct their houses with too
great a
desire to avoid cold and heat; lest the desire of wealth spring up,
from which cause divisions and discords arise; and that they may keep the
common
people in a contented state of mind, when each sees his own means placed
on an equality with [those of] the most powerful.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.23": [6.23] It is the greatest glory to
the several states to have as wide deserts as possible around them, their
frontiers having been laid
waste. They consider this the real evidence of their prowess, that
their neighbors shall be driven out of their lands and abandon them, and
that no one dare
settle near them; at the same time they think that they shall be on
that account the more secure, because they have removed the apprehension
of a sudden
incursion. When a state either repels war waged against it, or wages
it against another, magistrates are chosen to preside over that war with
such authority,
that they have power of life and death. In peace there is no common
magistrate, but the chiefs of provinces and cantons administer justice
and determine
controversies among their own people. Robberies which are committed
beyond the boundaries of each state bear no infamy, and they avow that
these are
committed for the purpose of disciplining their youth and of preventing
sloth. And when any of their chiefs has said in an assembly "that he will
be their
leader, let those who are willing to follow, give in their names;"
they who approve of both the enterprise and the man arise and promise their
assistance
and are applauded by the people; such of them as have not followed
him are accounted in the number of deserters and traitors, and confidence
in all
matters is afterward refused them. To injure guests they regard as
impious; they defend from wrong those who have come to them for any purpose
whatever, and esteem them inviolable; to them the houses of all are
open and maintenance is freely supplied.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.24": [6.24] And there was formerly a time
when the Gauls excelled the Germans in prowess, and waged war on them offensively,
and, on
account of the great number of their people and the insufficiency of
their land, sent colonies over the Rhine. Accordingly, the Volcae Tectosages,
seized on
those parts of Germany which are the most fruitful [and lie] around
the Hercynian forest, (which, I perceive, was known by report to Eratosthenes
and
some other Greeks, and which they call Orcynia), and settled there.
Which nation to this time retains its position in those settlements, and
has a very high
character for justice and military merit; now also they continue in
the same scarcity, indigence, hardihood, as the Germans, and use the same
food and
dress; but their proximity to the Province and knowledge of commodities
from countries beyond the sea supplies to the Gauls many things tending
to
luxury as well as civilization. Accustomed by degrees to be overmatched
and worsted in many engagements, they do not even compare themselves to
the
Germans in prowess.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.25": [6.25] The breadth of this Hercynian
forest, which has been referred to above, is to a quick traveler, a journey
of nine days. For it can
not be otherwise computed, nor are they acquainted with the measures
of roads. It begins at the frontiers of the Helvetii, Nemetes, and Rauraci,
and
extends in a right line along the river Danube to the territories of
the Daci and the Anartes; it bends thence to the left in a different direction
from the river,
and owing to its extent touches the confines of many nations; nor is
there any person belonging to this part of Germany who says that he either
has gone to
the extremity of that forest, though he had advanced a journey of sixty
days, or has heard in what place it begins. It is certain that many kinds
of wild beast
are produced in it which have not been seen in other parts; of which
the following are such as differ principally from other animals, and appear
worthy of
being committed to record.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.26": [6.26] There is an ox of the shape
of a stag, between whose ears a horn rises from the middle of the forehead,
higher and straighter
than those horns which are known to us. From the top of this, branches,
like palms, stretch out a considerable distance. The shape of the female
and of
the male is the, same; the appearance and the size of the horns is
the same.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.27": [6.27] There are also [animals] which
are called elks. The shape of these, and the varied color of their skins,
is much like roes, but in
size they surpass them a little and are destitute of horns, and have
legs without joints and ligatures; nor do they lie down for the purpose
of rest, nor, if they
have been thrown down by any accident, can they raise or lift themselves
up. Trees serve as beds to them; they lean themselves against them, and
thus
reclining only slightly, they take their rest; when the huntsmen have
discovered from the footsteps of these animals whither they are accustomed
to betake
themselves, they either undermine all the trees at the roots, or cut
into them so far that the upper part of the trees may appear to be left
standing. When
they have leant upon them, according to their habit, they knock down
by their weight the unsupported trees, and fall down themselves along with
them.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.28": [6.28] There is a third kind, consisting
of those animals which are called uri. These are a little below the elephant
in size, and of the
appearance, color, and shape of a bull. Their strength and speed are
extraordinary; they spare neither man nor wild beast which they have espied.
These
the Germans take with much pains in pits and kill them. The young men
harden themselves with this exercise, and practice themselves in this kind
of
hunting, and those who have slain the greatest number of them, having
produced the horns in public, to serve as evidence, receive great praise.
But not
even when taken very young can they be rendered familiar to men and
tamed. The size, shape, and appearance of their horns differ much from
the horns
of our oxen. These they anxiously seek after, and bind at the tips
with silver, and use as cups at their most sumptuous entertainments.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.29": [6.29] Caesar, after he discovered
through the Ubian scouts that the Suevi had retired into their woods, apprehending
a scarcity of
corn, because, as we have observed above, all the Germans pay very
little attention to agriculture, resolved not to proceed any further; but,
that he might
not altogether relieve the barbarians from the fear of his return,
and that he might delay their succors, having led back his army, he breaks
down, to the
length of 200 feet, the further end of the bridge, which joined the
banks of the Ubii, and at the extremity of the bridge raises towers of
four stories, and
stations a guard of twelve cohorts for the purpose of defending the
bridge, and strengthens the place with considerable fortifications. Over
that fort and
guard he appointed C. Volcatius Tullus, a young man; he himself, when
the corn began to ripen, having set forth for the war with Ambiorix (through
the
forest Arduenna, which is the largest of all Gaul, and reaches from
the banks of the Rhine and the frontiers of the Treviri to those of the
Nervii, and
extends over more than 500 miles), he sends forward L. Minucius Basilus
with all the cavalry, to try if he might gain any advantage by rapid marches
and
the advantage of time, he warns him to forbid fires being made in the
camp, lest any indication of his approach be given at a distance: he tells
him that he
will follow immediately.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.30": [6.30] Basilus does as he was commanded;
having performed his march rapidly, and even surpassed the expectations
of all, he
surprises in the fields many not expecting him; through their information
he advances toward Ambiorix himself, to the place in which he was said
to be with
a few horse. Fortune accomplishes much, not only in other matters,
but also in the art of war. For as it happened by a remarkable chance,
that he fell upon
[Ambiorix] himself unguarded and unprepared, and that his arrival was
seen by the people before the report or information of his arrival was
carried
thither; so it was an incident of extraordinary fortune that, although
every implement of war which he was accustomed to have about him was seized,
and
his chariots and horses surprised, yet he himself escaped death. But
it was effected owing to this circumstance, that his house being surrounded
by a wood
(as are generally the dwellings of the Gauls, who, for the purpose
of avoiding heat, mostly seek the neighborhood of woods and rivers), his
attendants and
friends in a narrow spot sustained for a short time the attack of our
horse. While they were fighting, one of his followers mounted him on a
horse; the
woods sheltered him as he fled. Thus fortune tended much both toward
his encountering and his escaping danger.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.31": [6.31] Whether Ambiorix did not collect
his forces from cool deliberation, because he considered he ought not to
engage in a battle,
or [whether] he was debarred by time and prevented by the sudden arrival
of our horse, when he supposed the rest of the army was closely following,
is
doubtful: but certainly, dispatching messengers through the country,
he ordered every one to provide for himself; and a part of them fled into
the forest
Arduenna, a part into the extensive morasses; those who were nearest
the ocean concealed themselves in the islands which the tides usually form;
many,
departing from their territories, committed themselves and all their
possessions to perfect strangers. Cativolcus, king of one half of the Eburones,
who had
entered into the design together with Ambiorix, since, being now worn
out by age, he was unable to endure the fatigue either of war or flight,
having
cursed Ambiorix with every imprecation, as the person who had been
the contriver of that measure, destroyed himself with the juice of the
yew-tree, of
which there is a great abundance in Gaul and Germany.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.32": [6.32] The Segui and Condrusi, of
the nation and number of the Germans, and who are between the Eburones
and the Treviri, sent
embassadors to Caesar to entreat that he would not regard them in the
number of his enemies, nor consider that the cause of all the Germans on
this side
the Rhine was one and the same; that they had formed no plans of war,
and had sent no auxiliaries to Ambiorix. Caesar, having ascertained this
fact by an
examination of his prisoners, commanded that if any of the Eburones
in their flight had repaired to them, they should be sent back to him;
he assures them
that if they did that, he will not injure their territories. Then,
having divided his forces into three parts, he sent the baggage of all
the legions to Aduatuca.
That is the name of a fort. This is nearly in the middle of the Eburones,
where Titurius and Aurunculeius had been quartered for the purpose of wintering.
This place he selected as well on other accounts as because the fortifications
of the previous year remained, in order that he might relieve the labor
of the
soldiers. He left the fourteenth legion as a guard for the baggage,
one of those three which he had lately raised in Italy and brought over.
Over that legion
and camp he places Q. Tullius Cicero and gives him 200 horse.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.33": [6.33] Having divided the army, he
orders T. Labienus to proceed with three legions toward the ocean into
those parts which border
on the Menapii; he sends C. Trebonius with a like number of legions
to lay waste that district which lies contiguous to the Aduatuci; he himself
determines
to go with the remaining three to the river Sambre, which flows into
the Meuse, and to the most remote parts of Arduenna, whither he heard that
Ambiorix
had gone with a few horse. When departing, he promises that he will
return before the end of the seventh day, on which day he was aware corn
was due
to that legion which was being left in garrison. He directs Labienus
and Trebonius to return by the same day, if they can do so agreeably to
the interests of
the republic; so that their measures having been mutually imparted,
and the plans of the enemy having been discovered, they might be able to
commence a
different line of operations.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.34": [6.34] There was, as we have above
observed, no regular army, nor a town, nor a garrison which could defend
itself by arms; but the
people were scattered in all directions. Where either a hidden valley,
or a woody spot, or a difficult morass furnished any hope of protection
or of security
to any one, there he had fixed himself. These places were known to
those who dwelt in the neighborhood, and the matter demanded great attention,
not
so much in protecting the main body of the army (for no peril could
occur to them altogether from those alarmed and scattered troops), as in
preserving
individual soldiers; which in some measure tended to the safety of
the army. For both the desire of booty was leading many too far, and the
woods with
their unknown and hidden routes would not allow them to go in large
bodies. If he desired the business to be completed and the race of those
infamous
people to be cut off, more bodies of men must be sent in several directions
and the soldiers must be detached on all sides; if he were disposed to
keep the
companies at their standards, as the established discipline and practice
of the Roman army required, the situation itself was a safeguard to the
barbarians,
nor was there wanting to individuals the daring to lay secret ambuscades
and beset scattered soldiers. But amid difficulties of this nature as far
as
precautions could be taken by vigilance, such precautions were taken;
so that some opportunities of injuring the enemy were neglected, though
the minds
of all were burning to take revenge, rather than that injury should
be effected with any loss to our soldiers. Caesar dispatches messengers
to the
neighboring states; by the hope of booty he invites all to him, for
the purpose of plundering the Eburones, in order that the life of the Gauls
might be
hazarded in the woods rather than the legionary soldiers; at the same
time, in order that a large force being drawn around them, the race and
name of that
state may be annihilated for such a crime. A large number from all
quarters speedily assembles.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.35": [6.35] These things were going on
in all parts of the territories of the Eburones, and the seventh day was
drawing near, by which day
Caesar had purposed to return to the baggage and the legion. Here it
might be learned how much fortune achieves in war, and how great casualties
she
produces. The enemy having been scattered and alarmed, as we related
above, there was no force which might produce even a slight occasion of
fear.
The report extends beyond the Rhine to the Germans that the Eburones
are being pillaged, and that all were without distinction invited to the
plunder. The
Sigambri, who are nearest to the Rhine, by whom, we have mentioned
above, the Tenchtheri and Usipetes were received after their retreat, collect
2,000
horse; they cross the Rhine in ships and barks thirty miles below that
place where the bridge was entire and the garrison left by Caesar; they
arrive at the
frontiers of the Eburones, surprise many who were scattered in flight,
and get possession of a large amount of cattle, of which barbarians are
extremely
covetous. Allured by booty, they advance further; neither morass nor
forest obstructs these men, born amid war and depredations; they inquire
of their
prisoners in what part Caesar is; they find that he has advanced further,
and learn that all the army has removed. Thereon one of the prisoners says,
"Why
do you pursue such wretched and trifling spoil; you, to whom it is
granted to become even now most richly endowed by fortune? In three hours
you can
reach Aduatuca; there the Roman army has deposited all its fortunes;
there is so little of a garrison that not even the wall can be manned,
nor dare any one
go beyond the fortifications." A hope having been presented them, the
Germans leave in concealment the plunder they had acquired; they themselves
hasten to Aduatuca, employing as their guide the same man by whose
information they had become informed of these things.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.36": [6.36] Cicero, who during all the
foregoing days had kept his soldiers in camp with the greatest exactness,
and agreeable to the
injunctions of Caesar, had not permitted even any of the camp-followers
to go beyond the fortification, distrusting on the seventh day that Caesar
would
keep his promise as to the number of days, because he heard that he
had proceeded further, and no report as to his return was brought to him,
and being
urged at the same time by the expressions of those who called his tolerance
almost a siege, if, forsooth, it was not permitted them to go out of the
camp,
since he might expect no disaster, whereby he could be injured, within
three miles of the camp, while nine legions and all the cavalry were under
arms, and
the enemy scattered and almost annihilated, sent five cohorts into
the neighboring corn-lands, between which and the camp only one hill intervened,
for the
purpose of foraging. Many soldiers of the legions had been left invalided
in the camp, of whom those who had recovered in this space of time, being
about
300, are sent together under one standard; a large number of soldiers'
attendants besides, with a great number of beasts of burden, which had
remained in
the camp, permission being granted, follow them.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.37": [6.37] At this very time, the German
horse by chance came up, and immediately, with the same speed with which
they had advanced,
attempt to force the camp at the Decuman gate, nor were they seen,
in consequence of woods lying in the way on that side, before they were
just reaching
the camp: so much so, that the sutlers who had their booths under the
rampart had not an opportunity of retreating within the camp. Our men,
not
anticipating it, are perplexed by the sudden affair, and the cohort
on the outpost scarcely sustains the first attack. The enemy spread themselves
on the
other sides to ascertain if they could find any access. Our men with
difficulty defend the gates; the very position of itself and the fortification
secures the
other accesses. There is a panic in the entire camp, and one inquires
of another the cause of the confusion, nor do they readily determine whither
the
standards should be borne, nor into what quarter each should betake
himself. One avows that the camp is already taken, another maintains that,
the
enemy having destroyed the army and commander-in-chief, are come hither
as conquerors; most form strange superstitious fancies from the spot, and
place before their eyes the catastrophe of Cotta and Titurius, who
had fallen in the same fort. All being greatly disconcerted by this alarm,
the belief of the
barbarians is strengthened that there is no garrison within, as they
had heard from their prisoner. They endeavor to force an entrance and encourage
one
another not to cast from their hands so valuable a prize.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.38": [6.38] P. Sextius Baculus, who had
led a principal century under Caesar (of whom we have made mention in previous
engagements),
had been left an invalid in the garrison, and had now been five days
without food. He, distrusting his own safety and that of all, goes forth
from his tent
unarmed; he sees that the enemy are close at hand and that the matter
is in the utmost danger; he snatches arms from those nearest, and stations
himself at
the gate. The centurions of that cohort which was on guard follow him;
for a short time they sustain the fight together. Sextius faints, after
receiving many
wounds; he is with difficulty saved, drawn away by the hands of the
soldiers. This space having intervened, the others resume courage so far
as to venture
to take their place on the fortifications and present the aspect of
defenders.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.39": [6.39] The foraging having in the
mean time been completed, our soldiers distinctly hear the shout; the horse
hasten on before and
discover in what danger the affair is. But here there is no fortification
to receive them, in their alarm: those last enlisted, and unskilled in
military discipline
turn their faces to the military tribune and the centurions; they wait
to find what orders may be given by them. No one is so courageous as not
to be
disconcerted by the suddenness of the affair. The barbarians, espying
our standard in the distance, desist from the attack; at first they suppose
that the
legions, which they had learned from their prisoners had removed further
off, had returned; afterward, despising their small number, they make an
attack
on them at all sides.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.40": [6.40] The camp-followers run forward
to the nearest rising ground; being speedily driven from this they throw
themselves among the
standards and companies: they thus so much the more alarm the soldiers
already affrighted. Some propose that, forming a wedge, they suddenly break
through, since the camp was so near; and if any part should be surrounded
and slain, they fully trust that at least the rest may be saved; others,
that they
take their stand on an eminence, and all undergo the same destiny.
The veteran soldiers whom we stated to have set out together [with the
others] under a
standard, do not approve of this. Therefore encouraging each other,
under the conduct of Caius Trebonius, a Roman knight, who had been appointed
over them, they break through the midst of the enemy, and arrive in
the camp safe to a man. The camp attendants and the horse following close
upon them
with the same impetuosity, are saved by the courage of the soldiers.
But those who had taken their stand upon the eminence having even now acquired
no
experience of military matters, neither could persevere in that resolution
which they approved of, namely, to defend themselves from their higher
position,
nor imitate that vigor and speed which they had observed to have availed
others; but, attempting to reach the camp, had descended into an unfavorable
situation. The centurions, some of whom had been promoted for their
valor from the lower ranks of other legions to higher ranks in this legion,
in order
that they might not forfeit their glory for military exploits previously
acquired, fell together fighting most valiantly. The enemy having been
dislodged by their
valor, a part of the soldiers arrived safe in camp contrary to their
expectations; a part perished, surrounded by the barbarians.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.41": [6.41] The Germans, despairing of
taking the camp by storm, because they saw that our men had taken up their
position on the
fortifications, retreated beyond the Rhine with that plunder which
they had deposited in the woods. And so great was the alarm, even after
the departure
of the enemy, that when C. Volusenus, who had been sent with the cavalry,
arrived that night, he could not gain credence that Caesar was close at
hand
with his army safe. Fear had so pre-occupied the minds of all, that
their reason being almost estranged, they said that all the other forces
having been cut
off, the cavalry alone had arrived there by flight, and asserted that,
if the army were safe, the Germans would not have attacked the camp; which
fear the
arrival of Caesar removed.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.42": [6.42] He, on his return, being well
aware of the casualties of war, complained of one thing [only], namely,
that the cohorts had been
sent away from the outposts and garrison [duty], and pointed out that
room ought not to have been left for even the most trivial casualty; that
fortune had
exercised great influence in the sudden arrival of their enemy; much
greater, in that she had turned the barbarians away from the very rampart
and gates of
the camp. Of all which events, it seemed the most surprising, that
the Germans, who had crossed the Rhine with this object, that they might
plunder the
territories of Ambiorix, being led to the camp of the Romans, rendered
Ambiorix a most acceptable service.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.43": [6.43] Caesar, having again marched
to harass the enemy, after collecting a large number [of auxiliaries] from
the neighboring states,
dispatches them in all directions. All the villages and all the buildings,
which each beheld, were on fire: spoil was being driven off from all parts;
the corn
not only was being consumed by so great numbers of cattle and men,
but also had fallen to the earth, owing to the time of the year and the
storms; so that
if any had concealed themselves for the present, still, it appeared
likely that they must perish through want of all things, when the army
should be drawn
off. And frequently it came to that point, as so large a body of cavalry
had been sent abroad in all directions, that the prisoners declared Ambiorix
had just
then been seen by them in flight, and had not even passed out of sight,
so that the hope of overtaking him being raised, and unbounded exertions
having
been resorted to, those who thought they should acquire the highest
favor with Caesar, nearly overcame nature by their ardor, and continually,
a little only
seemed wanting to complete success; but he rescued himself by [means
of] lurking-places and forests, and, concealed by the night made for other
districts
and quarters, with no greater guard than that of four horsemen, to
whom along he ventured to confide his life.
<p align="justify">"caes.gal.6.44": [6.44] Having devastated the country
in such a manner, Caesar leads back his army with the loss of two cohorts
to Durocortorum of
the Remi, and, having summoned a council of Gaul to assemble at that
place, he resolved to hold an investigation respecting the conspiracy of
the Senones
and Carnutes, and having pronounced a most severe sentence upon Acco,
who had been the contriver of that plot, he punished him after the custom
of
our ancestors. Some fearing a trial, fled; when he had forbidden these
fire and water, he stationed in winter quarters two legions at the frontiers
of the
Treviri, two among the Lingones, the remaining six at Agendicum, in
the territories of the Senones; and, having provided corn for the army,
he set out for
Italy, as he had determined, to hold the assizes.
