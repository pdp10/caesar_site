<p align="justify"> 49 B.C.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.1": [2.1] While these things were going
forward in Spain, Caius Trebonius, Caesar's lieutenant, who had been left
to conduct the assault of
Massilia, began to raise a mound, vineae, and turrets against the town,
on two sides; one of which was next the harbor and docks, the other on
that part
where there is a passage from Gaul and Spain to that sea which forces
itself up the mouth of the Rhone. For Massilia is washed almost on three
sides by
the sea, the remaining fourth part is the only side which has access
by land. A part even of this space, which reaches to the fortress, being
fortified by the
nature of the country, and a very deep valley, required a long and
difficult siege. To accomplish these works, Caius Trebonius sends for a
great quantity of carriages and men from the whole Province, and orders
hurdles and materials to be furnished. These things being provided, he
raised a mound eighty feet in height.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.2": [2.2] But so great a store of every
thing necessary for a war had been a long time before laid up in the town,
and so great a number of
engines, that no vineae made of hurdles could withstand their force.
For poles twelve feet in length, pointed with iron, and these too shot
from very large
engines, sank into the ground through four rows of hurdles. Therefore
the arches of the vineae were covered over with beams a foot thick, fastened
together, and under this the materials of the agger were handed from
one to another. Before this was carried a testudo sixty feet long, for
leveling the
ground, made also of very strong timber, and covered over with every
thing that was capable of protecting it against the fire and stones thrown
by the
enemy. But the greatness of the works, the height of the wall and towers,
and the multitude of engines retarded the progress of our works. Besides,
frequent sallies were made from the town by the Albici, and fire was
thrown on our mound and turrets. These our men easily repulsed, and, doing
considerable damage to those who sallied, beat them back into the town.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.3": [2.3] In the mean time, Lucius Nasidius,
being sent by Cneius Pompey with a fleet of sixteen sail, a few of which
had beaks of brass, to
the assistance of Lucius Domitius and the Massilians, passed the straits
of Sicily without the knowledge or expectation of Curio, and, putting with
his fleet
into Messana, and making the nobles and senate take flight with the
sudden terror, carried off one of their ships out of dock. Having joined
this to his other
ships, he made good his voyage to Massilia, and having sent in a galley
privately, acquaints Domitius and the Massilians of his arrival, and earnestly
encourages them to hazard another battle with Brutus's fleet with the
addition of his aid.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.4": [2.4] The Massilians, since their
former loss, had brought the same number of old ships from the docks, and
had repaired and fitted
them out with great industry: they had a large supply of seamen and
pilots. They had got several fishing-smacks, and covered them over, that
the seamen
might be secure against darts: these they filled with archers and engines.
With a fleet thus appointed, encouraged by the entreaties and tears of
all the old
men, matrons, and virgins to succor the state in this hour of distress,
they went on board with no less spirit and confidence than they had fought
before.
For it happens, from a common infirmity of human nature, that we are
more flushed with confidence, or more vehemently alarmed at things unseen,
concealed, and unknown, as was the case then. For the arrival of Lucius
Nasidius had filled the state with the most sanguine hopes and wishes.
Having got
a fair wind, they sailed out of port and went to Nasidius to Taurois,
which is a fort belonging to the Massilians, and there ranged their fleet
and again
encouraged each other to engage and communicated their plan of operation.
The command of the right division was given to the Massilians, that of
the left
to Nasidius.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.5": [2.5] Brutus sailed to the same place
with an augmented fleet; for to those made by Caesar at Arelas were added
six ships taken from
the Massilians, which he had refitted since the last battle and had
furnished with every necessary. Accordingly, having encouraged his men
to despise a
vanquished people whom they had conquered when yet unbroken, he advanced
against them full of confidence and spirit. From Trebonius's camp and all
the higher grounds it was easy to see into the town-how all the youth
which remained in it, and all persons of more advanced years, with their
wives and
children, and the public guards, were either extending their hands
from the wall to the heavens, or were repairing to the temples of the immortal
gods, and
prostrating themselves before their images, were entreating them to
grant them victory. Nor was there a single person who did not imagine that
his future
fortune depended on the issue of that day; for the choice of their
youth and the most respectable of every age, being expressly invited and
solicited, had
gone on board the fleet, that if any adverse fate should befall them
they might see that nothing was left for them to attempt, and, if they
proved victorious,
they might have hopes of preserving the city, either by their internal
resources or by foreign assistance.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.6": [2.6] When the battle was begun, no
effort of valor was wanting to the Massilians, but, mindful of the instructions
which they had a little
before received from their friends, they fought with such spirit as
if they supposed that they would never have another opportunity to attempt
a defense,
and as if they believed that those whose lives should be endangered
in the battle would not long precede the fate of the rest of the citizens,
who, if the city
was taken, must undergo the same fortune of war. Our ships being at
some distance from each other, room was allowed both for the skill of their
pilots
and the maueuvering of their ships; and if at any time ours, gaining
an advantage by casting the iron hooks on board their ships, grappled with
them, from
all parts they assisted those who were distressed. Nor, after being
joined by the Albici, did they decline coming to close engagement, nor
were they much
inferior to our men in valor. At the same time, showers of darts, thrown
from a distance from the lesser ships, suddenly inflicted several wounds
on our
men when off their guard and otherwise engaged; and two of their three-decked
galleys; having descried the ship of Decimus Brutus, which could be
easily distinguished by its flag, rowed up against him with great violence
from opposite sides: but Brutus, seeing into their designs, by the swiftness
of his
ship extricated himself with such address as to get clear, though only
by a moment. From the velocity of their motion they struck against each
other with
such violence that they were both excessively injured by the shock;
the beak, indeed, of one of them being broken off, the whole ship was ready
to
founder, which circumstance being observed, the ships of Brutus's fleet,
which were nearest that station, attack them when in this disorder and
sink them
both.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.7": [2.7] But Nasidius's ships were of
no use, and soon left the fight; for the sight of their country, or the
entreaties of their relations, did not
urge them to run a desperate risk of their lives. Therefore, of the
number of the ships not one was lost: of the fleet of the Massilians five
were sunk, four
taken, and one ran off with Nasidius: all that escaped made the best
of their way to Hither Spain, but one of the rest was sent forward to Massilia
for the
purpose of bearing this intelligence, and when it came near the city,
the whole people crowded out to hear the tidings, and, on being informed
of the event,
were so oppressed with grief, that one would have imagined that the
city had been taken by an enemy at the same moment. The Massilians, however,
began to make the necessary preparations for the defense of their city
with unwearied energy.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.8": [2.8] The legionary soldiers who had
the management of the works on the right side, observed, from the frequent
sallies of the enemy,
that it might prove a great protection to them to build a turret of
brick under the wall for a fort and place of refuge, which they at first
built low and small,
[to guard them] against sudden attacks. To it they retreated, and from
it they made defense if any superior force attacked them; and from it they
sallied out
either to repel or pursue the enemy. It extended thirty feet on every
side, and the thickness of the walls was five feet. But afterward, as experience
is the
best master in every thing on which the wit of man is employed, it
was found that it might be of considerable service if it was raised to
the usual height of
turrets, which was effected in the following manner.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.9": [2.9] When the turret was raised to
the height for flooring, they laid it on the walls in such a manner that
the ends of the joists were
covered by the outer face of the wall, that nothing should project
to which the enemy's fire might adhere. They, moreover, built over the
joists with small
bricks as high as the protection of the plutei and vineae permitted
them; and on that place they laid two beams across, angle-ways, at a small
distance
from the outer walls, to support the rafters which were to cover the
turret, and on the beams they laid joists across in a direct line, and
on these they
fastened down planks. These joists they made somewhat longer, to project
beyond the outside of the wall, that they might serve to hang a curtain
on them
to defend and repel all blows while they were building the walls between
that and the next floor, and the floor of this story they faced with bricks
and
mortar, that the enemy's fire might do them no damage; and on this
they spread mattresses, lest the weapons thrown from engines should break
through
the flooring, or stones from catapults should batter the brick work.
They, moreover, made three mats of cable ropes, each of them the length
of the turret
walls, and four feet broad, and, hanging them round the turret on the
three sides which faced the enemy, fastened them to the projecting joists.
For this
was the only sort of defense which, they had learned by experience
in other places, could not be pierced by darts or engines. But when that
part of the
turret which was completed was protected and secured against every
attempt of the enemy, they removed the plutei to other works. They began
to
suspend gradually, and raise by screws from the first-floor, the entire
roof of the turret, and then they elevated it as high as the length of
the mats allowed.
Hid and secured within these coverings, they built up the walls with
bricks, and again, by another turn of the screw, cleared a place for themselves
to
proceed with the building; and, when they thought it time to lay another
floor, they laid the ends of the beams, covered in by the outer bricks
in like manner
as in the first story, and from that story they again raised the uppermost
floor and the mat-work. In this manner, securely and without a blow or
danger,
they raised it six stories high, and in laying the materials left loop-holes
in such places as they thought proper for working their engines.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.10": [2.10] When they were confident that
they could protect the works which lay around from this turret, they resolved
to build a
musculus, sixty feet long, of timber, two feet square, and to extend
it from the brick tower to the enemy's tower and wall. This was the form
of it: first, two
beams of equal length were laid on the ground, at the distance of four
feet from each other; and in them were fastened small pillars, five feet
high, which
were joined together by braces, with a gentle slope, on which the timber
which they must place to support the roof of the musculus should be laid:
upon
this were laid beams, two feet square, bound with iron plates and nails.
To the upper covering of the musculus and the upper beams, they fastened
laths,
four fingers square, to support the tiles which were to cover the musculus.
The roof being thus sloped and laid over in rows in the same manner as
the
joists were laid on the braces, the musculus was covered with tiles
and mortar, to secure it against fire, which might be thrown from the wall.
Over the tiles
hides are spread, to prevent the water let in on them by spouts from
dissolving the cement of the bricks. Again, the hides were covered over
with
mattresses, that they might not be destroyed by fire or stones. The
soldiers under the protection of the vineae, finish this whole work to
the very tower;
and suddenly, before the enemy were aware of it, moved it forward by
naval machinery, by putting rollers under it, close up to the enemy's turret,
so that it
even touched the building.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.11": [2.11] The townsmen, affrighted at
this unexpected stroke, bring forward with levers the largest stones they
can procure, and pitching
them from the wall, roll them down on the musculus. The strength of
the timber withstood the shock; and whatever fell on it slid off, on account
of the
sloping roof. When they perceived this, they altered their plan, and
set fire to barrels, filled with resin and tar, and rolled them down from
the wall on the
musculus. As soon as they fell on it, they slid off again, and were
removed from its side by long poles and forks. In the mean time, the soldiers,
under
cover of the musculus, were rooting out with crow-bars the lowest stones
of the enemy's turret, with which the foundation was laid. The musculus
was
defended by darts, thrown from engines by our men from the brick tower,
and the enemy were beaten off from the wall and turrets; nor was a fair
opportunity of defending the walls given them. At length several stones
being picked away from the foundation of that turret next the musculus,
part of it
fell down suddenly, and the rest, as if following it, leaned forward.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.12": [2.12] Hereupon, the enemy distressed
at the sudden fall of the turret, surprised at the unforeseen calamity,
awed by the wrath of the
gods, and dreading the pillage of their city, rush all together out
of the gate unarmed, with their temples bound with fillets, and suppliantly
stretch out their
hands to the officers and the army. At this uncommon occurrence, the
whole progress of the war was stopped, and the soldiers, turning away from
the
battle, ran eagerly to hear and listen to them. When the enemy came
up to the commanders and the army, they all fell down at their feet, and
besought
them "to wait till Caesar's arrival; they saw that their city was taken,
our works completed, and their tower undermined, therefore they desisted
from a
defense; that no obstacle could arise, to prevent their being instantly
plundered at a beck, as soon as he arrived, if they refused to submit to
his orders."
They inform them that, "if the turret had entirely fallen down, the
soldiers could not be withheld from forcing into the town and sacking it,
in hopes of
getting spoil." These and several other arguments to the same effect
were delivered, as they were a people of great learning, with great pathos
and
lamentations.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.13": [2.13] The lieutenants moved with
compassion, draw off the soldiers from the work, desist from the assault,
and leave sentinels on the
works. A sort of truce having been made through compassion for the
besieged, the arrival of Caesar is anxiously awaited; not a dart was thrown
from the
walls or by our men, but all remit their care and diligence, as if
the business was at an end. For Caesar had given Trebonius strict charge
not to suffer the
town to be taken by storm, lest the soldiers, too much irritated both
by abhorrence of their revolt, by the contempt shown to them, and by their
long labor,
should put to the sword all the grown up inhabitants, as they threatened
to do. And it was with difficulty that they were then restrained from breaking
into
the town, and they were much displeased, because they imagined that
they were prevented by Trebonius from taking possession of it.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.14": [2.14] But the enemy, destitute of
all honor, only waited a time and opportunity for fraud and treachery.
And after an interval of some
days, when our men were careless and negligent, on a sudden, at noon,
when some were dispersed, and others indulging themselves in rest on the
very
works, after the fatigue of the day, and their arms were all laid by
and covered up, they sallied out from the gates, and, the wind being high
and favorable
to them, they set fire to our works; and the wind spread it in such
a manner that, in the same instant, the agger, plutei, testudo, tower,
and engines all
caught the flames and were consumed before we could conceive how it
had occurred. Our men, alarmed at such an unexpected turn of fortune, lay
hold
on such arms as they could find. Some rush from the camp; an attack
is made on the enemy: but they were prevented, by arrows and engines from
the
walls; from pursuing them when they fled. They retired to their walls,
and there, without fear, set the musculus and brick tower on fire. Thus,
by the perfidy
of the enemy and the violence of the storm, the labor of many months
was destroyed in a moment. The Massilians made the same attempt the next
day,
having got such another storm. They sallied out against the other tower
and agger, and fought with more confidence. But as our men had on the former
occasion given up all thoughts of a contest, so, warned by the event
of the preceding day, they had made every preparation for a defense. Accordingly,
they slew several, and forced the rest to retreat into the town without
effecting their design.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.15": [2.15] Trebonius began to provide
and repair what had been destroyed, with much greater zeal on the part
of the soldiers; for when
they saw that their extraordinary pains and preparations had an unfortunate
issue, they were fired with indignation that, in consequence of the impious
violation of the truce, their valor should be held in derision. There
was no place left them from which the materials for their mound could be
fetched, in
consequence of all the timber, far and wide, in the territories of
the Massilians, having been cut down and carried away; they began therefore
to make an
agger of a new construction, never heard of before, of two walls of
brick, each six feet thick, and to lay floors over them of almost the same
breadth with
the agger, made of timber. But wherever the space between the walls,
or the weakness of the timber, seemed to require it, pillars were placed
underneath
and traversed beams laid on to strengthen the work, and the space which
was floored was covered over with hurdles, and the hurdles plastered over
with
mortar. The soldiers, covered over head by the floor, on the right
and left by the wall, and in the front by the mantlets, carried whatever
materials were
necessary for the building without danger: the business was soon finished-the
loss of their laborious work was soon repaired by the dexterity and fortitude
of the soldiers. Gates for making sallies were left in the wall in
such places as they thought proper.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.16": [2.16] But when the enemy perceived
that those works, which they had hoped could not be replaced without a
great length of time,
were put into so thorough repair by a few day's labor and diligence,
that there was no room for perfidy or sallies, and that no means were left
them by
which they could either hurt the men by resistance or the works by
fire, and when they found by former examples that their town could be surrounded
with
a wall and turrets on every part by which it was accessible by land,
in such a manner that they could not have room to stand on their own fortifications,
because our works were built almost on the top of their walls by our
army, and darts could be thrown from our hands, and when they perceived
that all
advantage arising from their engines, on which they had built great
hopes, was totally lost, and that though they had an opportunity of fighting
with us on
equal terms from walls and turrets, they could perceive that they were
not equal to our men in bravery, they had recourse to the same proposals
of
surrender as before.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.17": [2.17] In Further Spain, Marcus Varro,
in the beginning of the disturbances, when he heard of the circumstances
which took place in
Italy, being diffident of Pompey's success, used to speak in a very
friendly manner of Caesar. That though, being pre-engaged to Cneius Pompey
in quality
of lieutenant, he was bound in honor to him, that, nevertheless, there
existed a very intimate tie between him and Caesar; that he was not ignorant
of what
was the duty of a lieutenant, who bore an office of trust; nor of his
own strength, nor of the disposition of the whole province to Caesar. These
sentiments
he constantly expressed in his ordinary conversation, and did not attach
himself to either party. But afterward, when he found that Caesar was detained
before Massilia, that the forces of Petreius had effected a junction
with the army of Afranius, that considerable reinforcements had come to
their
assistance, that there were great hopes and expectations, and heard
that the whole Hither province had entered into a confederacy, and of the
difficulties
to which Caesar was reduced afterward at Ilerda for want of provisions,
and Afranius wrote to him a fuller and more exaggerated account of these
matters, he began to regulate his movements by those of fortune.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.18": [2.18] He made levies throughout
the province; and, having completed his two legions, he added to them about
thirty auxiliary cohorts;
he collected a large quantity of corn to send partly to the Masilians,
partly to Afranius and Petreius. He commanded the inhabitants of Gades
to build ten
ships of war; besides, he took care that several others should be built
in Spain. He removed all the money and ornaments from the temple of Hercules
to
the town of Gades, and sent six cohorts thither from the province to
guard them, and gave the command of the town of Gades to Caius Gallonius,
a
Roman knight, and friend of Domitius, who had come thither sent by
Domitius to recover an estate for him; and he deposited all the arms, both
public and
private, in Gallonius's house. He himself [Varro] made severe harangues
against Caesar. He often pronounced from his tribunal that Caesar had fought
several unsuccessful battles, and that a great number of his men had
deserted to Afranius. That he had these accounts from undoubted messengers,
and
authority on which he could rely. By these means he terrified the Roman
citizens of that province, and obliged them to promise him for the service
of the
state one hundred and ninety thousand sesterces, twenty thousand pounds
weight of silver, and a hundred and twenty thousand bushels of wheat. He
laid
heavier burdens on those states which he thought were friendly disposed
to Caesar, and billeted troops on them; he passed judgment against some
private
persons, and condemned to confiscation the properties of those who
had spoken or made orations against the republic, and forced the whole
province to
take an oath of allegiance to him and Pompey. Being informed of all
that happened in Hither Spain, he prepared for war. This was his plan of
operations.
He was to retire with his two legions to Gades, and to lay up all the
shipping and provisions there. For he had been informed that the whole
province was
inclined to favor Caesar's party. He thought that the war might be
easily protracted in an island, if he was provided with corn and shipping.
Caesar,
although called back to Italy by many and important matters, yet had
determined to leave no dregs of war behind him in Spain, because he knew
that
Pompey had many dependents and clients in the hither province.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.19": [2.19] Having therefore sent two
legions into Further Spain under the command of Quintus Cassius, tribune
of the people; he himself
advances with six hundred horse by forced marches, and issues a proclamation,
appointing a day on which the magistrates and nobility of all the states
should attend him at Corduba. This proclamation being published through
the whole province, there was not a state that did not send a part of their
senate
to Corduba, at the appointed time; and not a Roman citizen of any note
but appeared that day. At the same time the senate at Corduba shut the
gates of
their own accord against Varro, and posted guards and sentinels on
the wall and in the turrets, and detained two cohorts (called Colonicae,
which had
come there accidentally), for the defense of the town. About the same
time the people of Carmona, which is by far the strongest state in the
whole
province, of themselves drove out of the town the cohorts, and shut
the gates against them, although three cohorts had been detached by Varro
to
garrison the citadel.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.20": [2.20] But Varro was in greater haste
on this account to reach Gades with his legion as soon as possible, lest
he should be stopped
either on his march or on crossing over to the island. The affection
of the province to Caesar proved so great and so favorable, that he received
a letter
from Gades, before he was far advanced on his march: that as soon as
the nobility of Gades heard of Caesar's proclamation, they had combined
with the
tribune of the cohorts, which were in garrison there, to drive Gallonius
out of the town, and to secure the city and island for Caesar. That having
agreed on
the design they had sent notice to Gallonius, to quit Gades of his
own accord while he could do it with safety; if he did not, they would
take measures for
themselves; that for fear of this Gallonius had been induced to quit
the town. When this was known, one of Varro's two legions, which was called
Vernacula, carried off the colors from Varro's camp, he himself standing
by and looking on, and retired to Hispalis, and took post in the market
and public
places without doing any injury, and the Roman citizens residing there
approved so highly of this act, that every one most earnestly offered to
entertain
them in their houses. When Varro, terrified at these things, having
altered his route, proposed going to Italica, he was informed by his friends
that the gates
were shut against him. Then indeed, when intercepted from every road,
he sends word to Caesar, that he was ready to deliver up the legion which
he
commanded. He sends to him Sextus Caesar, and orders him to deliver
it up to him. Varro, having delivered up the legion, went to Caesar to
Corduba,
and having laid before him the public accounts, handed over to him
most faithfully whatever money he had, and told him what quantity of corn
and
shipping he had, and where.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.21": [2.21] Caesar made a public oration
at Corduba, in which he returned thanks to all severally: to the Roman
citizens, because they had
been zealous to keep the town in their own power; to the Spaniards,
for having driven out the garrison; to the Gaditani, for having defeated
the attempts of
his enemies, and asserted their own liberty; to the Tribunes and Centurions
who had gone there as a guard, for having by their valor confirmed them
in
their purpose. He remitted the tax which the Roman citizens had promised
to Varro for the public use: he restored their goods to those who he was
informed had incurred that penalty by speaking too freely, having given
public and private rewards to some he filled the rest with flattering hopes
of his
future intentions; and having staid two days at Corduba, he set out
for Gades; he ordered the money and ornaments which had been carried away
from
the temple of Hercules, and lodged in the houses of private persons,
to be replaced in the temple. He made Quintus Cassius governor of the province,
and
assigned him four legions. He himself, with those ships which Marcus
Varro had built, and others which the Gaditani had built by Varro's orders,
arrived in
a few days at Tarraco, where embassadors from the greatest part of
the nearer province waited his arrival. Having in the same manner conferred
marks of
honor both publicly and privately on some states, he left Tarraco,
and went thence by land to Narbo, and thence to Massilia. There he was
informed that
a law was passed for creating a dictator, and that he had been nominated
dictator by Marcus Lepidus the praetor.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.22": [2.22] The Massilians, wearied out
by misfortunes of every sort, reduced to the lowest ebb for want of corn,
conquered in two
engagements at sea, defeated in their frequent sallies, and struggling
moreover with a fatal pestilence, from their long confinement and change
of victuals
(for they all subsisted on old millet and damaged barley, which they
had formerly provided and laid up in the public stores against an emergency
of this
kind), their turret being demolished, a great part of their wall having
given way, and despairing of any aid, either from the provinces or their
armies, for
these they had heard had fallen into Caesar's power, resolved to surrender
now without dissimulation. But a few days before, Lucius Domitius, having
discovered the intention of the Massilians, and having procured three
ships, two of which he gave up to his friends, went on board the third
himself, having
got a brisk wind, put out to sea. Some ships, which by Brutus's orders
were constantly cruising near the port, having espied him, weighed anchor,
and
pursued him. But of these, the ship on board of which he was, persevered
itself, and continuing its flight, and by the aid of the wind got out of
sight: the
other two, affrighted by the approach of our galleys put back again
into the harbor. The Massilians conveyed their arms and engines out of
the town, as
they were ordered: brought their ships out of the port and docks, and
delivered up the money in their treasury. When these affairs were dispatched,
Caesar, sparing the town more out of regard to their renown and antiquity
than to any claim they could lay to his favor, left two legions in garrison
there,
sent the rest to Italy, and set out himself for Rome.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.23": [2.23] About the same time Caius
Curio, having sailed from Sicily to Africa, and from the first despising
the forces of Publius Attius
Varus, transported only two of the four legions which he had received
from Caesar, and five hundred horse, and having spent two days and three
nights
on the voyage, arrived at a place called Aquilaria, which is about
twenty-two miles distant from Clupea, and in the summer season has a convenient
harbor, and is inclosed by two projecting promontories. Lucius Caesar
the son, who was waiting his arrival near Clupea with ten ships which had
been
taken near Utica in a war with the pirates, and which Publius Attius
had had repaired for this war, frightened at the number of our ships, fled
the sea, and
running his three-decked covered galley on the nearest shore, left
her there and made his escape by land to Adrumetum. Caius Considius Longus,
with a
garrison of one legion, guarded this town. The rest of Caesar's fleet,
after his flight, retired to Adrumetum. Marcus Rufus, the quaestor, pursued
him with
twelve ships, which Curio had brought from Sicily as convoy to the
merchantmen, and seeing a ship left on the shore, he brought her off by
a towing rope,
and returned with his fleet to Curio.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.24": [2.24] Curio detached Marcus before
with the fleet to Utica, and marched thither with his army. Having advanced
two days, he came
to the river Bagrada, and there left Caius Caninius Rebilus, the lieutenant,
with the legions; and went forward himself with the horse to view the Cornelian
camp, because that was reckoned a very eligible position for encamping.
It is a straight ridge, projecting into the sea, steep and rough on both
sides, but
the ascent is more gentle on that part which lies opposite Utica. It
is not more than a mile distant from Utica in a direct line. But on this
road there is a
spring, to which the sea comes up, and overflows; an extensive morass
is thereby formed; and if a person would avoid it, he must make a circuit
of six
miles to reach the town.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.25": [2.25] Having examined this place,
Curio got a view of Varus's camp, joining the wall and town, at the gate
called Bellica, well
fortified by its natural situation, on one side by the town itself,
on the other by a theater which is before the town, the approaches to the
town being
rendered difficult and narrow by the very extensive out-buildings of
that structure. At the same time he observed the roads very full of carriages
and cattle,
which they were conveying from the country into the town on the sudden
alarm. He sent his cavalry after them to plunder them and get the spoil.
And at
the same time Varus had detached as a guard for them six hundred Numidian
horse, and four hundred foot, which king Juba had sent to Utica as
auxiliaries a few days before. There was a friendship subsisting between
his [Juba's] father and Pompey, and a feud between him and Curio, because
he,
when a tribune of the people, had proposed a law, in which he endeavored
to make public property of the kingdom of Juba. The horse engaged; but
the
Numidians were not able to stand our first charge; but a hundred and
twenty being killed, the rest retreated into their camp near the town.
In the mean
time, on the arrival of his men of war, Curio ordered proclamation
to be made to the merchant ships, which lay at anchor before Utica, in
number about
two hundred, that he would treat as enemies all that did not set sail
immediately for the Cornelian camp. As soon as the proclamation was made,
in an
instant they all weighed anchor and left Utica, and repaired to the
place commanded them. This circumstance furnished the army with plenty
of every thing.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.26": [2.26] After these transactions,
Curio returned to his camp to Bragada; and by a general shout of the whole
army was saluted
imperator. The next day he led his army to Utica, and encamped near
the town. Before the works of the camp were finished, the horse upon guard
brought him word that a large supply of horse and foot sent by king
Juba were on their march to Utica, and at the same time a cloud of dust
was
observed, and in a moment the front of the line was in sight. Curio,
surprised at the suddenness of the affair, sent on the horse to receive
their first charge,
and detain them. He immediately called off his legions from the work,
and put them in battle array. The horse began the battle: and before the
legions
could be completely marshaled and take their ground, the king's entire
forces being thrown into disorder and confusion, because they had marched
without any order, and were under no apprehensions, betake themselves
to flight: almost all the enemy's horse being safe, because they made a
speedy
retreat into the town along the shore, Caesar's soldiers slay a great
number of their infantry.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.27": [2.27] The next night two Marsian
centurions with twenty-two men belonging to the companies, deserted from
Curio's camp to Attius
Varus. They, whether they uttered the sentiments which they really
entertained, or wished to gratify Varus (for what we wish we readily give
credit to, and
what we think ourselves, we hope is the opinion of other men), assured
him, that the minds of the whole army were disaffected to Curio, that it
was very
expedient that the armies should be brought in view of each other,
and an opportunity of a conference be given. Induced by their opinion,
Varus the next
day led his troops out of the camp: Curio did so in like manner, and
with only one small valley between them, each drew up his forces.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.28": [2.28] In Varus's army there was
one Sextus Quintilius Varus who, as we have mentioned before, was at Corfinium.
When Caesar
gave him his liberty, he went over to Africa; now, Curio had transported
to Africa those legions which Caesar had received under his command a short
time before at Corfinium; so that the officers and companies were still
the same, excepting the change of a few centurions. Quintilius, making
this a pretext
for addressing them, began to go round Curio's lines, and to entreat
the soldiers "not to lose all recollection of the oath which they took
first to Domitius
and to him their quaestor, nor bear arms against those who had shared
the same fortune, and endured the same hardships in a siege, nor fight
for those by
whom they had been opprobriously called deserters." To this he added
a few words by way of encouragement, what they might expect from his own
liberality, if they should follow him and Attius. On the delivery of
this speech, no intimation of their future conduct is given by Curio's
army, and thus both
generals led back their troops to their camp.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.29": [2.29] However, a great and general
fear spread through Curio's camp, for it is soon increased by the various
discourses of men. For
every one formed an opinion of his own; and to what he had heard from
others, added his own apprehensions. When this had spread from a single
author
to several persons, and was handed from one another, there appeared
to be many authors for such sentiments as these: "That it was a civil war;
that they
were men; and therefore that it was lawful for them to act freely,
and follow which party they pleased." These were the legions which a short
time before
had belonged to the enemy; for the custom of offering free towns to
those who joined the opposite party had changed Caesar's kindness. For
the harshest
expressions of the soldiers in general did not proceed from the Marsi
and Peligni, as those which passed in the tents the night before; and some
of their
fellow soldiers heard them with displeasure. Some additions were also
made to them by those who wished to be thought more zealous in their duty.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.30": [2.30] For these reasons, having
called a council, Curio began to deliberate on the general welfare. There
were some opinions, which
advised by all means an attempt to be made, and an attack on Varus's
camp; for when such sentiments prevailed among the soldiers, they thought
idleness
was improper. In short, they said "that it was better bravely to try
the hazard of war in a battle, than to be deserted and surrounded by their
own troops,
and forced to submit to the greatest cruelties." There were some who
gave their opinion, that they ought to withdraw at the third watch to the
Cornelian
camp; that by a longer interval of time the soldiers might be brought
to a proper way of thinking; and also, that if any misfortune should befall
them, they
might have a safer and readier retreat to Sicily, from the great number
of their ships.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.31": [2.31] Curio, censuring both measures,
said, "that the one was as deficient in spirit, as the other exceeded in
it: that the latter advised a
shameful flight, and the former recommended us to engage at a great
disadvantage. For on what, says he, can we rely that we can storm a camp,
fortified
both by nature and art? Or, indeed, what advantage do we gain if we
give over the assault, after having suffered considerable loss; as if success
did not
acquire for a general the affection of his army, and misfortune their
hatred? But what does a change of camp imply but a shameful flight and
universal
despair, and the alienation of the army? For neither ought the obedient
to suspect that they are distrusted, nor the insolent to know that we fear
them;
because our fears augment the licentiousness of the latter, and diminish
the zeal of the former. But if, says he, we were convinced of the truth
of the reports
of the disaffection of the army (which I indeed am confident are either
altogether groundless, or at least less than they are supposed to be),
how much
better to conceal and hide our suspicions of it, than by our conduct
confirm it? Ought not the defects of an army to be as carefully concealed
as the
wounds in our bodies, lest we should increase the enemy's hopes? but
they moreover advise us to set out at midnight, in order, I suppose, that
those who
attempt to do wrong may have a fairer opportunity; for conduct of this
kind is restrained either by shame or fear, to the display of which the
night is most
averse. Wherefore, I am neither so rash as to give my opinion that
we ought to attack their camp without hopes of succeeding; nor so influenced
by fear
as to despond: and I imagine that every expedient ought first to be
tried; and I am in a great degree confident that I shall form the same
opinions as
yourselves on this matter."
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.32": [2.32] Having broken up the council,
he called the soldiers together, and reminded them "what advantage Caesar
had derived from
their zeal at Corfinium; how by their good offices and influence he
had brought over a great part of Italy to his interest. For, says he, all
the municipal
towns afterward imitated you and your conduct; nor was it without reason
that Caesar judged so favorably, and the enemy so harshly of you. For
Pompey, though beaten in no engagement, yet was obliged to shift his
ground, and leave Italy, from the precedent established by your conduct.
Caesar
commited me, whom he considered his dearest friend, and the provinces
of Sicily and Africa, without which he was not able to protect Rome or
Italy, to
your protection. There are some here present who encourage you to revolt
from us; for what can they wish for more, than at once to ruin us, and
to
involve you in a heinous crime? or what baser opinions could they in
their resentment entertain of you, than that you would betray those who
acknowledged themselves indebted to you for every thing, and put yourselves
in the power of those who think they have been ruined by you? Have you
not heard of Caesar's exploits in Spain? that he routed two armies,
conquered two generals, recovered two provinces, and effected all this
within forty
days after he came in sight of the enemy? Can those who were not able
to stand against him while they were uninjured, resist him when they are
ruined?
Will you, who took part with Caesar while victory was uncertain, take
part with the conquered enemy when the fortune of the war is decided, and
when
you ought to reap the reward of your services? For they say that they
have been deserted and betrayed by you, and remind you of a former oath.
But did
you desert Lucius Domitius, or did Lucius Domitius desert you? Did
he not, when you were ready to submit to the greatest difficulties, cast
you off? Did
he not, without your privacy, endeavor to effect his own escape? When
you were betrayed by him, were you not preserved by Caesar's generosity?
And
how could he think you bound by your oath to him, when, after having
thrown up the ensigns of power, and abdicated his government, he became
a
private person, and a captive in another's power? A new obligation
is left upon you, that you should disregard the oath, by which you are
at present
bound; and have respect only to that which was invalidated by the surrender
of your general, and his diminution of rank. But I suppose, although you
are
pleased with Caesar, you are offended with me; however, I shall not
boast of my services to you, which still are inferior to my own wishes
or your
expectations. But, however, soldiers have ever looked for the rewards
of labor at the conclusion of a war; and what the issue of it is likely
to be, not even
you can doubt. But why should I omit to mention my own diligence and
good fortune, and to what a happy crisis affairs are now arrived? Are you
sorry
that I transported the army safe and entire, without the loss of a
single ship? That on my arrival, in the very first attack, I routed the
enemy's fleet? That
twice in two days I defeated the enemy's horse? That I carried out
of the very harbor and bay two hundred of the enemy's victualers, and reduced
them to
that situation that they can receive no supplies either by land or
sea? Will you divorce yourselves from this fortune and these generals;
and prefer the
disgrace of Corfinium, the defeat of Italy, the surrender of both Spains,
and the prestige of the African war? I, for my part, wished to be called
a soldier of
Caesar's; you honored me with the title of Imperator. If you repent
your bounty, I give it back to you; restore to me my former name that you
may not
appear to have conferred the honor on me as a reproach."
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.33": [2.33] The soldiers, being affected
by this oration, frequently attempted to interrupt him while he was speaking,
so that they appeared
to bear with excessive anguish the suspicion of treachery, and when
he was leaving the assembly they unanimously besought him to be of good
spirits, and
not hesitate to engage the enemy and put their fidelity and courage
to a trial. As the wishes and opinions of all were changed by this act,
Curio, with the
general consent, determined, whenever opportunity offered, to hazard
a battle. The next day he led out his forces and ranged them in order of
battle on
the same ground where they had been posted the preceding day; nor did
Attius Varus hesitate to draw out his men, that, if any occasion should
offer,
either to tamper with our men or to engage on equal terms he might
not miss the opportunity.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.34": [2.34] There lay between the two
armies a valley, as already mentioned, not very deep, but of a difficult
and steep ascent. Each was
waiting till the enemy's forces should attempt to pass it, that they
might engage with the advantage of the ground. At the same time on the
left wing, the
entire cavalry of Publius Attius, and several light-armed infantry
intermixed with them, were perceived descending into the valley. Against
them Curio
detached his cavalry and two cohorts of the Marrucini, whose first
charge the enemy's horse were unable to stand, but, setting spurs to their
horses, fled
back to their friends: the light-infantry being deserted by those who
had come out along with them, were surrounded and cut to pieces by our
men.
Varus's whole army, facing that way, saw their men flee and cut down.
Upon which Rebilus, one of Caesar's lieutenants, whom Curio had brought
with
him from Sicily knowing that he had great experience in military matters,
cried out, "You see the enemy are daunted, Curio! why do you hesitate to
take
advantage of the opportunity?" Curio, having merely "expressed this,
that the soldiers should keep in mind the professions which they had made
to him the
day before," then ordered them to follow him, and ran far before them
all. The valley was so difficult of assent that the foremost men could
not struggle up
it unless assisted by those behind. But the minds of Attius's soldiers
being prepossessed with fear and the flight and slaughter of their men,
never thought of
opposing us; and they all imagined that they were already surrounded
by our horse, and, therefore, before a dart could be thrown, or our men
come near
them, Varus's whole army turned their backs and retreated to their
camp.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.35": [2.35] In this flight one Fabius,
a Pelignian common soldier in Curio's army, pursuing the enemy's rear,
with a loud voice shouted to
Varus by his name, and often called him, so that he seemed to be one
of his soldiers, who wished to speak to him and give him advice. When Varus,
after
been repeatedly called, stopped and looked at him, and inquired who
he was and what he wanted, he made a blow with his sword at his naked shoulder
and was very near killing Varus, but he escaped the danger by raising
his shield to ward off the blow. Fabius was surrounded by the soldiers
near him and
cut to pieces; and by the multitude and crowds of those that fled,
the gates of the camps were thronged and the passage stopped, and a greater
number
perished in that place without a stroke than in the battle and flight.
Nor were we far from driving them from this camp; and some of them ran
straightway
to the town without halting. But both the nature of the ground and
the strength of the fortifications prevented our access to the camp; for
Curio's soldiers,
marching out to battle, were without those things which were requisite
for storming a camp. Curio, therefore, led his army back to the camp, with
all his
troops safe except Fabius. Of the enemy about six hundred were killed
and a thousand wounded, all of whom, after Curio's return, and several
more,
under pretext of their wounds, but in fact through fear, withdrew from
the camp into the town, which Varus perceiving and knowing the terror of
his army,
leaving a trumpeter in his camp and a few tents for show, at the third
watch led back his army quietly into the town.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.36": [2.36] The next day Curio resolved
to besiege Utica, and to draw lines about it. In the town there was a multitude
of people, ignorant
of war, owing to the length of the peace; some of them Uticans, very
well inclined to Caesar, for his favors to them; the Roman population was
composed
of persons differing widely in their sentiments. The terror occasioned
by former battles was very great; and therefore, they openly talked of
surrendering,
and argued with Attius that he should not suffer the fortune of them
all to be ruined by his obstinacy. While these things were in agitation,
couriers, who
had been sent forward, arrived from king Juba, with the intelligence
that he was on his march, with considerable forces, and encouraged them
to protect
and defend their city, a circumstance which greatly comforted their
desponding hearts.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.37": [2.37] The same intelligence was
brought to Curio; but for some time he could not give credit to it, because
he had so great
confidence in his own good fortune. And at this time Caesar's success
in Spain was announced in Africa by messages and letters. Being elated
by all these
things, he imagined that the king would not dare to attempt any thing
against him. But when he found out, from undoubted authority, that his
forces were
less than twenty miles distant from Utica, abandoning his works, he
retired to the Cornelian camp. Here he began to lay in corn and wood, and
to fortify
his camp, and immediately dispatched orders to Sicily, that his two
legions and the remainder of his cavalry should be sent to him. His camp
was well
adapted for protracting a war, from the nature and strength of the
situation, from its proximity to the sea, and the abundance of water and
salt, of which a
great quantity had been stored up from the neighboring salt-pits. Timber
could not fail him from the number of trees, nor corn, with which the lands
abounded. Wherefore, with the general consent, Curio determined to
wait for the rest of his forces, and protract the war.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.38": [2.38] This plan being settled, and
his conduct approved of, he is informed by some deserters from the town
that Juba had staid
behind in his own kingdom, being called home by a neighboring war,
and a dispute with the people of Leptis; and that Sabura, his commander-in-chief,
who had been sent with a small force, was drawing near to Utica. Curio
rashly believing this information, altered his design, and resolved to
hazard a
battle. His youth, his spirits, his former good fortune and confidence
of success, contributed much to confirm this resolution. Induced by these
motives,
early in the night he sent all his cavalry to the enemy's camp near
the river Bagrada, of which Sabura, of whom we have already spoken, was
the
commander. But the king was coming after them with all his forces,
and was posted at a distance of six miles behind Sabura. The horse that
were sent
perform their march that night, and attack the enemy unawares and unexpectedly;
for the Numidians, after the usual barbarous custom, encamped here
and there without any regularity. The cavalry having attacked them,
when sunk in sleep and dispersed, killed a great number of them; many were
frightened and ran away. After which the horse returned to Curio, and
brought some, prisoners with them.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.39": [2.39] Curio had set out at the fourth
watch with all his forces, except five cohorts which he left to guard the
camp. Having advanced
six miles, he met the horse, heard what had happened and inquired from
the captives who commanded the camp at Bagrada. They replied Sabura.
Through eagerness to perform his journey, he neglected to make further
inquiries, but looking back to the company next him, "Don't you see, soldiers,"
says he, "that the answer of the prisoners corresponds with the account
of the deserters, that the king is not with him, and that he sent only
a small force
which was not able to withstand a few horse? Hasten then to spoil,
to glory; that we may now begin to think of rewarding you, and returning
you thanks."
The achievements of the horse were great in themselves, especially
if their small number be compared with the vast host of Numidians. However,
the
account was enlarged by themselves, as men are naturally inclined to
boast of their own merit. Besides, many spoils were produced; the men and
horses
that were taken were brought into their sight, that they might imagine
that every moment of time which intervened was a delay to their conquest.
By this
means the hope of Curio were seconded by the ardor of the soldiers.
He ordered the horse to follow him, and hastened his march, that he might
attack
them as soon as possible, while in consternation after their flight.
But the horse, fatigued by the expedition of the preceding night, were
not able to keep up
with him, but fell behind in different places. Even this did not abate
Curio's hopes.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.40": [2.40] Juba, being informed by Sabura
of the battle in the night, sent to his relief two thousand Spanish and
Gallic horse, which he was
accustomed to keep near him to guard his person, and that part of his
infantry on which he had the greatest dependence, and he himself followed
slowly
after with the rest of his forces and forty elephants, suspecting that
as Curio had sent his horse before, he himself would follow them. Sabura
drew up his
army, both horse and foot, and commanded them to give way gradually
and retreat through the pretense of fear; that when it was necessary he
would give
them the signal for battle, and such orders as he found circumstances
required. Curio, as his idea of their present behavior was calculated to
confirm his
former hopes, imagined that the enemy were running away, and led his
army from the rising grounds down to the plain.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.41": [2.41] And when he had advanced from
this place about sixteen miles, his army being exhausted with the fatigue,
he halted. Sabura
gave his men the signal, marshaled his army, and began to go around
his ranks and encourage them. But he made use of the foot only for show;
and sent
the horse to the charge: Curio was not deficient in skill, and encouraged
his men to rest all their hopes in their valor. Neither were the soldiers,
though
wearied, nor the horse, though few and exhausted with fatigue, deficient
in ardor to engage, and courage: but the latter were in number but two
hundred:
the rest had dropped behind on the march. Wherever they charged they
forced the enemy to give ground, but they were not able to pursue them
far when
they fled, or to press their horses too severely. Besides, the enemy's
cavalry began to surround us on both wings and to trample down our rear.
When any
cohorts ran forward out of the line, the Numidians, being fresh, by
their speed avoided our charge, and surrounded ours when they attempted
to return to
their post, and cut them off from the main body. So that it did not
appear safe either to keep their ground and maintain their ranks, or to
issue from the
line, and run the risk. The enemy's troops were frequently reinforced
by assistance sent from Juba; strength began to fail our men through fatigue;
and
those who had been wounded could neither quit the field nor retire
to a place of safety, because the whole field was surrounded by the enemy's
cavalry.
Therefore, despairing of their own safety, as men usually do in the
last moment of their lives, they either lamented their unhappy deaths,
or recommended
their parents to the survivors, if fortune should save any from the
impending danger. All were full of fear and grief.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.42": [2.42] When Curio perceived that
in the general consternation neither his exhortations nor entreaties were
attended to, imagining that
the only hope of escaping in their deplorable situation was to gain
the nearest hills, he ordered the colors to be borne that way. But a party
of horse, that
had been sent by Sabura, had already got possession of them. Now indeed
our men were reduced to extreme despair: and some of them were killed by
the cavalry in attempting to escape: some fell to the ground unhurt.
Cneius Domitius, commander of the cavalry, standing round Curio with a
small party of
horse, urged Curio to endeavor to escape by flight, and to hasten to
his camp; and assured him that he would not forsake him. But Curio declared
that he
would never more appear in Caesar's sight, after losing the army which
had been committed by Caesar, to his charge, and accordingly fought till
he was
killed. Very few of the horse escaped from that battle, but those who
had staid behind to refresh their horses having perceived at a distance
the defeat of
the whole army, retired in safety to their camp.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.43": [2.43] The soldiers were all killed
to a man. Marcus Rufus, the quaestor, who was left behind in the camp by
Curio, having got
intelligence of these things, encouraged his men not to be disheartened.
They beg and entreat to be transported to Sicily. He consented, and ordered
the
masters of the ships to have all the boats brought close to the shore
early in the evening. But so great was the terror in general, that some
said that Juba's
forces were marching up, others that Varus was hastening with his legions,
and that they already saw the dust raised by their coming; of which not
one
circumstance had happened: others suspected that the enemy's fleet
would immediately be upon them. Therefore in the general consternation,
every man
consulted his own safety. Those who were on board of the fleet, were
in a hurry to set sail, and their flight hastened the masters of the ships
of burden. A
few small fishing boats attended their duty and his orders. But as
the shores were crowded, so great was the struggle to determine who of
such a vast
number should first get on board, that some of the vessels sank with
the weight of the multitude, and the fears of the rest delayed them from
coming to the
shore.
<p align="justify">"caes.civ.2.44": [2.44] From which circumstances it
happened that a few foot and aged men, that could prevail either through
interest or pity, or who
were able to swim to the ships, were taken on board, and landed safe
in Sicily. The rest of the troops sent their centurions as deputies to
Varus at night,
and surrendered themselves to him. But Juba the next day having spied
their cohorts before the town, claimed them as his booty, and ordered great
part
of them to be put to the sword; a few he selected and sent home to
his own realm. Although Varus complained that his honor was insulted by
Juba, yet he
dare not oppose him: Juba rode on horseback into the town, attended
by several senators, among whom were Servius Sulpicius and Licinius Damasippus,
and in a few days arranged and ordered what he would have done in Utica,
and in a few days more returned to his own kingdom, with all his forces.
